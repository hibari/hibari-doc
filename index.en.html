requires Erlang/OTP R13B01 or newer.  Hibari has been tested most
recently with Erlang/OTP R13B04.  Support for Erlang/OTP R14B01 in
progress.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Hibari’s Documentation</strong></span></p><p>The <a class="ulink" href="hibari-app-developer-guide.en.html" target="_top">Hibari Application

mobile messaging and email services.  Hibari was released outside of
Gemini under the Apache Public License version 2.0 in July 2010.
Hibari was moved from SourceForge to GitHub in January 2011.</p><p>Hibari has been deployed by multiple telecom carriers in Asia and
Europe.  Hibari may lack some features such as monitoring, event and
alarm management, and other "production environment" support services.
Since telecom operator has its own data center support infrastructure,
Hibari’s development has not included many services that would be
redundant in a carrier environment.  We hope that Hibari’s release to
the open source community will close those functional gaps as Hibari
spreads outside of carrier data centers.</p><p>Gemini Mobile Technologies provides full support, consulting, and
development services for Hibari. Please see the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.geminimobile.com/products/Hibari.html" target="_top">Gemini Mobile
Technologies Hibari page</a> for more information.  Please see the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.geminimobile.com/" target="_top">Gemini Mobile Technologies Web page</a> for
general information.</p><p>Gemini Mobile® and HyperScale® are registered trademarks of Gemini
