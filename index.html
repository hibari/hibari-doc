consistency guarantee. Hibari is written in Erlang and designed for

<span class="strong"><strong>Fast, Read Optimized:</strong></span> Hibari serves read and write requests in
  short and predictable latency. Hibari has excellent performance
  especially for read and large value operations
</li><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong"><strong>High Bandwidth:</strong></span> Batch and lock-less operations help to achieve
  high throughput while ensuring data consistency and durability
</li><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong"><strong>Big Data:</strong></span> Can store Peta Bytes of data by automatically
  distributing data across servers. The largest production Hibari
  cluster spans across 100 of servers
</li><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong"><strong>Reliable:</strong></span> High fault tolerance by replicating data between
  servers. Data is repaired automatically after a server failure
</li></ul></div><p>Hibari is able to deliver scalable high performance that is
competitive with leading open source NOSQL (Not Only SQL) storage
systems, while also providing the data durability and strong
consistency that many systems lack. Hibari’s performance relative to
other NOSQL systems is particularly strong for reads and for large
value (&gt; 200KB) operations.</p><p>As one example of real-world performance, in a multi-million user
webmail deployment equipped with traditional HDDs (non SSDs), Hibari
is processing about 2,200 transactions per second, with read latencies
averaging between 1 and 20 milliseconds and write latencies averaging
between 20 and 80 milliseconds.</p></div><div class="section" title="2. Distinct Features"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_distinct_features"></a>2. Distinct Features</h2></div></div></div><p>Unlike many other distributed databases, Hibari uses "<span class="strong"><strong>chain

mobile messaging and email services.  Hibari was released outside of
Gemini under the Apache Public License version 2.0 in July 2010.
Hibari was moved from SourceForge to GitHub in January 2011.</p><p>Hibari has been deployed by multiple telecom carriers in Asia and
Europe.  Hibari may lack some features such as monitoring, event and
alarm management, and other "production environment" support services.
Since telecom operator has its own data center support infrastructure,
Hibari’s development has not included many services that would be
redundant in a carrier environment.  We hope that Hibari’s release to
the open source community will close those functional gaps as Hibari
spreads outside of carrier data centers.</p><pre class="screen">Copyright (C) 2005-2015 Hibari developers.  All rights reserved.
