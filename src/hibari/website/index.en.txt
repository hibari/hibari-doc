*Hibari's Documentation*

The link:hibari-app-developer-guide.en.html[Hibari Application
Developer's Guide] is a good first step to get started quickly.  Check
the download, the build, and the install instructions.  The
link:hibari-tutorial.en.html[Hibari Tutorial] is another resource that
highlights key sections of the
link:hibari-app-developer-guide.en.html[Hibari Application Developer's
Guide].

Two additional documents are the
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html[Hibari System Administrator's
Guide] and the link:hibari-contributor-guide.en.html[Hibari
Contributor's Guide].  Reading the System Administrator's Guide is
_STRONGLY_ recommended.

Read the link:webpage-CHANGELOG.html[CHANGELOG] page for a full list
of additions, changes, and bug fixes.

Read the link:webpage-FAQ.html[FAQ] page for common questions and
answers.

The documentation is in a state of change and improvement.
Contributions from the wider world are welcome.  :-)

*Hibari's Origins*

Hibari was originally written by Gemini Mobile Technologies to support
mobile messaging and email services.  Hibari was released outside of
Gemini under the Apache Public License version 2.0 in July 2010.
Hibari was moved from SourceForge to GitHub in January 2011.

Hibari has been deployed by multiple telecom carriers in Asia and
Europe.  Hibari may lack some features such as monitoring, event and
alarm management, and other "production environment" support services.
Since telecom operator has its own data center support infrastructure,
Hibari's development has not included many services that would be
redundant in a carrier environment.  We hope that Hibari's release to
the open source community will close those functional gaps as Hibari
spreads outside of carrier data centers.

Gemini Mobile Technologies provides full support, consulting, and
development services for Hibari. Please see the
http://www.geminimobile.com/products/Hibari.html[Gemini Mobile
Technologies Hibari page] for more information.  Please see the
http://www.geminimobile.com/[Gemini Mobile Technologies Web page] for
general information.
