== Introduction

CAUTION: This document is under re-construction - beware!

This document's goal is to describe the software architecture of the
Hibari key-value database, discuss parts of its implementation, and to
document the Hibari client APIs.

At a minimum, application developers need to know how to use the
various Hibari client APIs.  Hibari is a key-value database, which
almost by definition have a small API.  Learning the basics isn't too
difficult.  To be really effective, however, application developers
also need to have a good overall understanding of how Hibari works.

For developers interested in working on Hibari itself, the source code
is the ultimate documentation.  But like most software developed in an
industrial setting, Hibari grew at times quite quickly and at times
sat on the shelf, waiting for customer demand.  Anyone who works with
the software, including Hibari's original developers, need
documentation to understand not only how something works but also why
certain choices were made ... and what parts need more work.

=== Topics Covered

* Discussion of Hibari's implementation
** The audience for this section is developers who wish to understand
   Hibari's implementation at a deeper level and add new features, fix
   bugs, or just generally tinker with and experiment on the system.

=== Reading the Systems Administrator Guide Is Strongly Recommended

IMPORTANT: To avoid a lot of cut-and-paste text, many of the
operational details that a developer should know or must know about
Hibari are found in the link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html[Hibari System
Administrator's Guide].  This document assumes that a developer has
already skimmed the System Administrator's Guide and is willing to jump
over to that guide when necessary.

== Hibari Internals: The Source, Module by Module

It would be wonderful to say that Hibari sprang from someone's
forehead, fully formed and adult, like the goddess Athena's birth from
the forehead of Zeus.  Software development is usually a bit more
organic and unplanned than that.  Hibari is no exception.

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away ... Hibari started as a
small, focused replacement for Mnesia, the database bundled with
Erlang/OTP.  Gemini Mobile was bidding on a project that required an
extremely high throughput database, with high availability and data
durability guarantees for a workload with a very low read/write ratio
(i.e. very write-intensive).  The amount of money dedicated to
hardware was fixed.  Mnesia could do the job very well, except for the
throughput.  Gemini needed something both faster and simpler.  The
skeleton of Hibari was written in haste, in case Gemini got the
contract.

Fortunately, Gemini lost the bid for the contract.  Hibari sat on the
shelf for a while, then picked up and developed as a main memory
database, like Mnesia.  Then requirements changed.  Then a project was
canceled, and Hibari set aside.  Then picked up and set aside again.
Each time, requirements changed.

Hindsight is perfect.  This section will attempt to give the reader,
developers who are maintaining Hibari or adding new features, some
background for why the code is structured the way it is.  The APIs for
some modules are straightforward to use, and others are not so clear.
Some modules were written together in a brief period of time, and
other evolved slowly over several years.

[[major-subsystems]]
=== Major subsystems

* Server (aka the brick)
* Chain replication
* Consistent hashing
* Client
* Admin Server
* Miscellaneous

[[server-modules]]
==== Server (aka the "logical brick") modules

As described in the
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#bricks-outside-chain-replication[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Bricks outside of chain replication" section], a
Hibari logical brick can be used with or without chain replication.
When used without chain replication, each brick is a standalone data
storage entity.  Any replication of data across logical bricks must be
done by the client, typically by a ``quorum replication'' technique.

The source modules that implement the logical brick are divided into
two groups:

Write-ahead logging, aka disk persistence:: The following modules
maintain the write-ahead logs on disk.  See the
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#write-ahead-logs[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Write-Ahead Logs" section] for a description of the
two types of write-ahead log and how they interact with each other.
  * `gmt_hlog.erl`
  * `gmt_hlog_common.erl`
  * `gmt_hlog_local.erl`
Protocol service and in-memory data management:: The following modules
handle Hibari client requests and manage the in-core binary trees used
for key management:
  * `brick_ets.erl`
  * `brick_server.erl`

[[chain-replication-modules]]
==== Chain replication modules

The chain replication algorithm is implemented in `brick_server.erl`.
That module also contains server and client code, which helps explain
why it's the largest source module in the Hibari application.

[[consistent-hashing-modules]]
==== Consistent hashing modules

The consistent hashing algorithm is implemented in the
`brick_simple.erl` module.  The code in this module has two roles:

* The "gen_server" callbacks for the `brick_simple` registered process
  that runs on each brick node.  This server receives updates from the
  Admin Server when there are changes to chain membership.
* Client-side stub functions, executed by a Hibari client application,
  to implement the client API that uses consistent hashing.

[[client-modules]]
==== Client modules

Hibari clients fall into two categories: those that use consistent
hashing and those that do not.

* As described in xref:consistent-hashing-modules[], the
  `brick_simple.erl` module implements the client API that uses
  consistent hashing.
* The `brick_server.erl` module implements the low-level client API
  that is not aware of consistent hashing.
* The `brick_squorum.erl` module is a partial implementation of a
  ``quorum replication'' method for managing data consistency across
  multiple logical bricks.  This module is used only by the Admin
  Server and is tailored to the Admin Server's use.  It should not be
  used by other quorum replication-based applications.

[[admin-server-modules]]
==== Admin Server modules

See link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#admin-server-app[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "The Admin Server Application" section] for a
description of the various services provided by the Admin Server
application.

* `brick_admin.erl` provides the major external API to most of the
  Admin Server's function as well as basic table management
  functions.
* `brick_bp.erl` implements the ``brick pinger'' processes.  Each
  pinger process is responsible for monitoring the health of a single
  Hibari logical brick.
* `brick_chainmon.erl` implements the ``chain monitor'' processes.
  Each chain monitor is responsible for monitoring the status of a
  single Hibari chain and to reconfigure the chain safely as its member
  bricks crash and restart.
* `brick_migmon.erl` implements the server process that is responsible
  for monitoring data migrations that take place whenever chains are
  added, deleted, or reweighted.
* `brick_sb.erl` implements the ``scoreboard'' process, which provides
  historical data about each brick and chain state transition.

[[misc-modules]]
==== Miscellaneous modules

These modules do a variety of things, including the Erlang/OTP
application and supervisor behaviors that create a single, cohesive
application.  They will be described in more detail below.

[[admin-server-crash-recovery]]
=== Admin Server notes: crash-recovery design

The xref:admin-server-modules[] indirectly outlines many of the
processes that, when grouped together, form the Hibari Admin Server
application:

* The main Admin Server process.
* Many ``brick pinger'' processes
* Many ``chain monitor'' processes
* The ``migration monitor'' process
* The ``scoreboard'' process
* ... and several other long- and short-lived processes,
  discussed in xref:module-by-module-commentary.

Acting together, these processes maintain data consistency for all
bricks in a Hibari cluster.  However, individual processes can crash
and restart at unpredictable times.  The Admin Server must be able to
recover correctly from a failure of any number of its helper
processes, regardless of timing.

[NOTE]
=====================
The Admin Server implementation was written for correctness
first and for speed/efficiency only when necessary.  It has been used
in production environments with rough total of 2,000 logical brick
pinger and chain monitor processes.  At this scale, the implementation
shows signs of stress under the worst-case scenario of "Restart the
Admin Server *and* all logical bricks on *all* physical bricks
simultaneously", but it works none-the-less.

[[refactor-admin-monitor]]
NOTE: An increase in size by a factor of 4 or 5 will probably hit the limits
of the current implementation.  It's likely that splitting the Admin
Server monolith into separate sub-servers, perhaps each servicing a
single table, would be a good refactoring task?
=====================

The architecture decision to have one Admin Server process, one
scoreboard process, one pinger process per brick and one health
monitor per chain is quite intentional.  If there is only one at a
given time performing a given task, then there cannot be race
conditions.

[[module-by-module-commentary]]
=== Module-By-Module Commentary

The modules in this section appear in alphabetical order.  For an
overview of their use by functional category, see
xref:major-subsystems[].

[[brick-erl]]
==== brick.erl

This module provides the Erlang/OTP "application" behavior for the
Hibari application.  Such modules are usually quite small.  The reason
why `brick.erl` doesn't fit the small pattern is that it has some
extra logic to shutdown logical bricks in a particular order when
application shutdown has been requested.

[[brick-admin-erl]]
==== brick_admin.erl

Please see link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#admin-server-app[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "The Admin Server Application" section] for a
description of the Admin Server's various functions.

The Admin Server has a "schema", though perhaps that's a poor choice
of name.  The schema defines:

* Each Hibari table
* The consistent hashing `{TableName, Key}` -> chain mapping
* Status of any data migrations

The schema, together with the ``scoreboard'' operational history, is
stored in the ``bootstrap bricks''.
See link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#bootstrap-bricks[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Admin Server's Private State: the Bootstrap Bricks" section]
and link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#bricks-outside-chain-replication[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Bricks outside of chain replication" section] for
more details.

Functions for creating a new schema and defining the names of the
bootstrap bricks that will store the schema are in this module.  So
are assorted functions for querying the schema, such as
`brick_admin:get_tables/0` and `brick_admin:get_table_chain_list/2`.
Changes to chain length and chain addition/deletion/reweighting are
also available here.

===== Global Hash spamming
[[spamming-the-global-hash]]
When a chain health monitor process makes a major state transition, it
will notify the Admin Server of the change.  The Admin Server will
then broadcast, or "spam" status notifications to all server and
client nodes.  The data structure spammed is a `#g_hash_r` record, or
simply a "global hash record". This record is maintained by the admin
server per table. Each table has its own unique global hash record.

****
For Erlang nodes running the full Hibari application, these global
hash pushes are automatic and require no extra configuration.

For Erlang nodes that run only the Hibari client application
(called `gdss_client`), *additional configuration is required* to add that
node's name to the client spam list. This is because the admin server
uses the output of the nodes() function to know what clients it needs to
spam the global hash to. Client monitoring causes nodes which are alive to
be connected to the admin server automatically. See:

* The "Client monitoring API" comment in the exports section at the
top of brick_admin.erl
* and/or the "Add/Delete a client node monitor" link at the bottom of
the Admin Server HTTP top-level status page at port 23080.
****

NOTE: Among other things, the global hash contains the bricks
and their roles in each chain. In this manner, a gdss client can
know which chain a key belongs to and what brick in that chain
is acting as head or tail. In this manner they can talk directly
to the correct brick for a given operation.

NOTE: The admin server increments a minor revision number in the global hash
for each update. Bricks and clients can then compare this revision number
to what they already have to ensure that they don't revert to using
an older global hash.

===== "Fast Sync" utility

The `brick_admin:fast_sync()` family of functions are an attempt to
help Hibari cluster administrators to perform bulk-copies of data from
in-service bricks to bricks that have zero data.  For example,
consider a physical brick has crashed due to data loss caused by a
hard disk failure.  The crashed brick can be put back into service
after fixing the disk problem, but the brick's data has been lost.
Chain replication can create new replicas of the lost data, but the
chain replication implementation can create a lot of disk I/O on the
upstream brick for long periods of time, e.g. several days for
terabytes of data.  The `fast_sync()` function attempts to minimize
the amount of random disk I/O by copying keys & values in file+offset
sorted order.

See xref:scavenger-and-code-reuse[].

[[brick-admin-erl-processes]]
===== Processes created by brick_admin.erl

* A "gen_server" for the Admin Server main process.
* The ``bootstrap scan'' process, which scans all keys in the
  bootstrap bricks every 5 seconds and repairs any inconsistencies
  created by crashing & restarting bootstrap bricks and/or a crash of
  the Admin Server itself.
* Each request to "spam" a new global hash record to all servers and
  clients will spawn a process to send the new global hash to all
  server nodes and then all `brick_simple` servers on all nodes.
* The "fast sync" bulk data copy API will spawn a process to
  coordinate the bulk data copy activities.

[[brick-admin-event-h-erl]]
==== brick_admin_event_h.erl

The Admin Server registers the brick_admin_event_h.erl as an event
handler with the partition detector application.  It's
`handle_event()` function takes action for two kinds of events:

* If a network heartbeat alarm is set, an app log message is
  generated.  If the alarm is on the 'A' network, that node is
  forcibly disconnected from the VM's `net_kernel` services.
* If another Admin Server instance is detected, the Hibari application
  will be stopped and the VM halted.

[[brick-admin-sup-erl]]
==== brick_admin_sup.erl

This is the supervisor for Admin Server-related processes.  If the
Admin Server application is not running, this supervisor will have no
children to monitor.

[NOTE]
==================================
A careful reader will notice that the preceding paragraph
contains a contradiction.  The Hibari `gdss` application is an OTP
application.  This document speaks of the Admin Server as being a
separate OTP application, because the Admin Server is managed by the
OTP kernel's application controller.

The contradiction is: the Admin Server's processes are supervised by
another application's supervisor.
==================================

The simple answer is: the Admin Server is not a 100% OTP-compliant
application.

The complicated answer is: it is complicated.  There's so much
day-to-day developer activity that relies on the Admin Server that
it's really inconvenient to package the Admin Server as a 100%
OTP-compliant application.  It's much, much more convenient to have
its source code and its processes mixed in with the rest of the Hibari
server code and processes.

So, the Admin Server application is OTP-compliant enough to be managed
by the OTP application controller.  But it is conveniently managed,
source-wise and process-wise, within the Hibari/`gdss` application as
a whole.

[[brick-bp-erl]]
==== brick_bp.erl

This module implements the ``brick pinger'' server: a "gen_fsm"
process that is responsible for polling the health of a single logical
brick.  The Admin Server starts a "brick pinger" process for each
logical brick in each chain in every table.
See the
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#brick-lifecycle-fsm[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Brick Lifecycle Finite State Machine" section] for a
description of the state machine implemented by this module.

A 1-second periodic timer is used to check the status of the brick
that this FSM monitors.  Any major changes in status will be sent as a
proplist to the "scoreboard" proc (see xref:brick-chainmon-erl[]) .

[[refactor-brick-bp]]
[NOTE]
=====================================
There are two areas where this module could use some refactoring:

* This "gen_fsm" module isn't very FSM-ish in style; it more resembles
"gen_server" style programming instead of "gen_fsm".

* The current communication pattern for health monitoring is too
brittle.  When a "pinger" detects a change of state, it informs the
"scoreboard" process.  But the "scoreboard" server does not actively
notify the chain monitor process; instead, the "chain monitor" process
polls the scoreboard and then calculates changes in brick state based
on the results of the previous polling.  This can cause information
about state changes to get lost.
+
The "pinger" and "chain monitor" processes are now quite robust in
dealing with corner cases where state changes happen really rapidly,
but the result is code that's more complex and difficult to maintain
than it should be.
=====================================

Health polling is based on two attributes: brick repair state and
brick repair time.  Due to the polling nature of this interface (a
weakness, see the "NOTE" section above), it's possible that a logical
brick in certain repair states X could crash, restart, and reenter the
state X before the "pinger" polled again.  The logical brick's start
time is checked to make certain that the "pinger" is talking to the
same PID over time.

===== Processes created by brick_bp.erl

* A long-lived process starts running the `brick_monitor_simple()`
  function, which creates a monitor to the remote logical brick and
  then waits for a `{'DOWN', ...}` message from that monitor.
* When an illegal state transition has been detected, a short-lived
  function is spawned to kill the remote node before it does something
  even more illegal than it already has.

[[brick-brick-sup-erl]]
==== brick_brick_sup.erl

This is the direct supervisor for all logical bricks that run on this
node.  The `brick_shepherd.erl` module provides the interface used to
request that this supervisor start & stop a logical brick.

[[brick-chainmon-erl]]
==== brick_chainmon.erl

This module implements the ``chain monitor'' server: a "gen_fsm"
process that is responsible for monitoring the health of all logical
bricks within a single chain.  The Admin Server starts a "chain
monitor" for each chain in every table.
See the
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#chain-lifecycle-fsm[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Chain Lifecycle Finite State Machine" section] for a
description of the state machine implemented by this module.

See the xref:brick-bp-erl[] for an overview of the polling method used
by both the brick health "pinger" processes, the "chain monitor"
processes, and the "scoreboard" and that method's known limitations.

In addition to monitoring health, the chain monitor proc is
responsible for taking actions required to repair the chain.

Chain member status is tricky to calculate correctly.  Any chain
monitor process may crash at any time (e.g. due to bugs), or the
entire machine hosting the monitor may crash.  When the monitor has
restarted, it doesn't know how many times chain members may have
changed state.

Each monitor queries the "scoreboard" to get the current status of
each chain member.  (Remember: The scoreboard's info may be slightly
out-of-date!)  Each current status is compared with the monitor's
in-memory history of the status during the last check.  (All bricks
start in the `unknown` state.)  If there's a difference, then suitable
action is taken.

Also, any change in brick or chain status is also reported to the
scoreboard.

Each brick's scoreboard status is converted to an internal status:

`unknown`::  The brick's status is not known.
`disk_error`:: The brick has hit a disk checksum error and has
  not been able to initialize itself 100%.
`pre_init`:: The brick is running and ping'able, but the
  brick is not in service, and the state of the brick's local
  storage is unknown.
`repairing`:: The monitor has chosen this brick to be the next
  brick to resume service in the chain.  Its local storage is actively
  being repaired by chain's current tail.
`repair_overload`::  If a brick was in `repairing' state and was
  determined to be overloaded (usually by too much disk I/O),
  the node can be switched to this state to halt repair.
`ok`:: The brick is fully in-sync with the rest of the chain
  and is in service in its correct chain role.

There are times when the chain monitor detects a chain that has zero
running bricks.  It must then examine the operational history of all
bricks in the chain and determine which is the best brick to start
first.  This must be the last brick to crash.  The chain monitor will
wait forever for that "best brick" to start.  If it is impossible to
start (for example, the machine was destroyed by fire, or data was
lost due to a disk failure), then a human may use the
`force_best_first_brick()` function to give permission to the chain
monitor to start another brick as the chain's first brick.

There are times when a chain monitor restarts and discovers that some
or all bricks in the chain are running.  However, the new chain
monitor cannot know exactly what roles each brick was in without
polling each one ... and because a chain transition may have been
interrupted by a chain monitor crash, it is quite tricky to make
correct decisions about what running bricks are OK and which ones are
not.

The uncertainty of each brick's exact status could be addressed by
more logging of intermediate states to the Admin Server's private
state (i.e. stored in the `bootstrap_copy`* bricks).  But each write
to that private state has an overhead that, when multiplied by
thousands of bricks and hundreds of chains, is quite significant.

When a chain monitor starts, it attempts to calculate the chain's
status.  If the chain was `healthy` before the monitor crash, the chain
will be deemed `healthy`.  If the chain was `degraded`, then it's
likely that the chain will be "whittled down" to a single brick and
then reconstructed using the chain repair protocol.

[[refactor-brick-chainmon]]
[NOTE]
=========================================
The reconstruction of the exact repair state & role of each brick in a
chain should be refactored to be smarter and therefore reduce the
total time required to return a chain to `healthy` state in more/all
failure scenarios.  The current implementation is pretty conservative
and has room for improvement.
=========================================

The `process_brickstatus_diffs()` function is a long, long bear of a
function.  Refactoring it would be useful, even necessary if the
polling-based mechanism were changed (as suggested elsewhere).  But it
encodes a lot of hard-won knowledge of how to maintain data
consistency under really weird, hard-to-find and hard-to-fix bugs over
more than two years of testing and production use.

IMPORTANT: Read the code and the comments before embarking on any
refactoring journey.

===== Processes created by brick_chainmon.erl

* The `digraph` stdlib module is used for chain status reconstruction.
  A separate process is used to idiot-proof and exception-proof the
  cleanup of ETS tables and other resources used by that library
  code.

[[brick-cinfo-erl]]
==== brick_cinfo.erl

This module implements the callbacks for the OTP application
`cluster_info`, bundled with Hibari.  Functions such as
`cluster_info:dump_all_connected/1` can be used to write a huge amount
of diagnostic information about the cluster.

At startup time, both the `gdss` and `gdss_client` applications
register a callback with the `cluster_info` application.

[[brick-client-data-sup-erl]]
==== brick_client_data_sup.erl

This is a supervisor used by the `gdss_client` application.

[[brick-client-erl]]
==== brick_client.erl

This is the start/stop module for the `gdss_client` application.  If
the `gdss` application is not running on each node that a Hibari
client application runs, then the lighter-weight `gdss_client`
application must be running.

[[brick-clientmon-erl]]
==== brick_clientmon.erl

This process implements a "gen_server" that monitor the condition of
each client node that is monitored by the Admin Server.  See the
`brick_admin:run_client_monitor_procs()` function for the definition
of the funs used when the client monitor sense that a client node has
stopped or started.

[[brick-client-sup-erl]]
==== brick_client_sup.erl

This is a supervisor used by the `gdss_client` application.

[[brick-data-sup-erl]]
==== brick_data_sup.erl

This is the `gdss` application supervisor that is responsible for
supervising all processes related to logical bricks:

* The "common log" write-ahead log
* The actual logical brick supervisor
* The brick "shepherd" to start & stop logical bricks
* The "simple" table state server (to support for the Hibari client
  `brick_simple.erl` API.
* The brick mailbox monitor
* The checkpoint I/O throttle server
* The brick "primer" throttle server

[[brick-ets-erl]]
==== brick_ets.erl

In an ideal world, `brick_ets.erl` would be a flexible plug-in module
to implement the data store for a Hibari logical brick.  With regard
to management of in-memory data structures (i.e. ETS `ordered_set`
tables, which are implemented as balanced binary trees), this module
is mostly self-contained.  For disk-based persistence, it uses the
write-ahead log modules `gmt_hlog.erl`, `gmt_hlog_common.erl`, and
`gmt_hlog_local.erl`) to handle disk I/O-related activity.

In the real world, `brick_ets.erl` is a mongrel, a mix of various
tasks: some memory related, some disk related, and some other stuff.
A "pluggable storage system" was not part of Hibari's original design.
The original design called for two kinds of bricks, with two separate
implementations: one RAM-based and one disk-based.  The RAM-based one
was written first: it was the original `brick_ets.erl` module, to be
used as part of a quorum-style replication system.  The disk-based
module was delayed.

Then Hibari development stopped.  Then it restarted, but this time
needing to meet larger-than-RAM storage requirements and to use chain
replication (instead of quorum replication).  The decision was made to
split the `brick_ets.erl` module was several pieces:

* `brick_ets.erl` would maintain the RAM-based data structures
* `gmt_hlog.erl` would maintain the disk-based write-ahead log
* `brick_server.erl` would maintain chain replication & repair logic

[[refactor-brick-ets]]
NOTE: Ideally, each of those three modules would have a strict
separation of concerns.  In reality, the split isn't very clean.
There are some remnants of chain replication code and write-ahead log
code in `brick_ets.erl`.  There are small bits of ETS table management
code in `brick_server.erl`.  There are refactoring opportunities there
to finish the module-splitting work that was never fully finished.

A big legacy of the original, everything-in-`brick_ets.erl`
implementation are the functions with names prefixed by "bcb_".  "BCB"
= "Brick CallBack".  These functions are required by
`brick_server.erl` for various purposes that also need access to the
ETS tables managed by `brick_ets.erl`.

[[brick-ets-matroshka]]
===== "gen_server" nested inside a "gen_server", Matroshka-style

Originally, the principal process for a logical brick was a
"gen_server" behavior process that was implemented by
`brick_ets.erl`.  When the `brick_ets.erl` module was split apart, the
choice was made to do the following:

* The "gen_server" process would use `brick_server.erl` as its
  implementation module and use its own `#state` record which is
  _completely independent of the `brick_ets.erl` `#state` record.
* Keep the "gen_server" behavior callbacks in `brick_ets.erl`
* Use a layer of indirection to allow `brick_server.erl` code manage
  the behavior callbacks and `#state` of `brick_ets.erl`

NOTE: This choice complicates `brick_server.erl` a little bit but
avoided a lot of refactoring work in `brick_ets.erl`.  It isn't clear
if now is a good time to review that decision.

===== State record

The `#state` record used by `brick_ets.erl` has members in several
major categories:

* Major configuration items, e.g. `do_logging` and `bigdata_dir`
* Operation counts, e.g. `n_add` and `syncsum_count`
* Log management, e.g. `logging_op_serial` and `log`
* Checkpoint management, e.g. `check_pid`
* ETS tables, e.g. `ctab` and `shadowtab`
* Dirty key management, e.g. `dirty_tab` and `wait_on_dirty_q`

[[refactor-brick-ets-state]]
NOTE: The `#state` record is probably too big.  Profiling suggests
that a substantial amount of CPU time is being spent in
`erlang:setelement()`; I'm guessing that's related to `#state` record
updates, but I'm not 100% certain.  There are about 43 members in that
record, so refactoring by moving some items (e.g. operation counts
like `n_add`) to the process dictionary or ETS is likely a good idea.

[[brick-ets-erl-ets-tables]]
===== ETS tables

* `#state.ctab`, the contents table.  Except for changes made during a
  checkpoint, all data about a key lives in this table as a "store
  tuple" (see below).
* `#state.dirty_tab`, the dirty table.  If a key has been updated but
  not yet flushed to disk, the key appears here.  Necessary for any
  update, inside or outside of a micro-transaction, where race
  conditions are possible.  See xref:dirty-keys-table[].
* `#state.etab`, the expiry table.  If a key has a non-zero expiry time
  associated with it (an integer in UNIX `time_t` form), then the
  expiry time appears in this table.
* `#state.mdtab`, the brick private metadata table.  Used for private
  state management during data migration and other tasks.
* `#state.shadowtab`, the shadow table.  During checkpoints, the
  `#state.ctab` table is frozen while the checkpoint process dumps its
  contents.  All updates made while the checkpoint is running (insert
  or delete) are stored in this table.  When the checkpoint is
  finished, the contents of this table are applied to the contents
  table, and then the shadow table is deleted.

[[store-tuple]]
===== The "store tuple"

A "store tuple" is the internal representation of a key's metadata.
It uses a variable-sized tuple to try to save some memory, avoiding
storing common values.  This is the tuple that is stored in the
`#state.ctab` table.

[options="header",cols="^m,^m,^m,^m,^m,^m"]
|=========
| Element 1 | Element 2 | Element 3 | Element 4 | Element 5 | Element 6
| {Key, | TStamp, | Value, | ValueLen} | |
| {Key, | TStamp, | Value, | ValueLen, | ExpTime} |
| {Key, | TStamp, | Value, | ValueLen, | Flags} |
| {Key, | TStamp, | Value, | ValueLen, | ExpTime, | Flags}
|=========

Types used:

* `Key = binary()`
* `TStamp = integer()`
* `Value = binary() | {integer(), integer()}`
** For value blob storage in RAM, `Value = binary()`
** For value blob storage on disk, `Value = {FileNumber::integer(),
   Offset::integer()}` where `FileNumber` and `Offset` give the
   starting location for the write-ahead log "hunk" that stores the
   actual value blob.
* `ValueLen = integer()`
* `ExpTime = integer()`
* `Flags = list()`

===== Logical brick initialization and WAL scan

The time required for full initialization of a logical brick is not
predictable.  We cannot know in advance how much metadata must be read
from the brick's private write-ahead log, nor do we know how much time
it will take to read that data.

The OTP "supervisor" behavior places a limit on how long a worker
process's init() function can take, and while a supervisor is starting
a worker process, it is blocked from starting/restarting/stopping
other workers.  Therefore, it's very important that the logical brick
initialization function execute in a short amount of time.

The second-to-last statement in `brick_ets:init/1` is this:

    self() ! do_init_second_half,

Then the `handle_info/3` callback can take as much time as is
necessary to read & process the updates in the private write-ahead
log.

[[dirty-keys-table]]
===== The dirty keys table

Here are some examples of why the dirty keys table,
`#state.dirty_tab`, is used (not an exhaustive list):

* To prevent more than one `add` operations succeeding.  If key `K`
  does not exist, and if multiple clients race to `add(Table, K, Value)`,
  then only one client should succeed.
* To prevent more than one update operation from succeeding with the same
  `{testset,CurrentTimeStamp}` flag.
* To prevent more than one micro-transaction from committing when
  using exclusive operations (e.g. `replace`) and/or exclusive flags
  (e.g. `{testset,CurrentTimeStamp}` and `key_must_exist`).

A Hibari micro-transaction is designed to avoid holding locks by
forcing the client to send the entire micro-transaction in a single
message.  The server brick's gen_server should immediately be able to
enforce the above properties, correct?  Yes and no, unfortunately.

Because each logical brick is implemented as a single "gen_server"
process (we ignore the helper processes enumerated in
xref:brick-ets-erl-processes[]), all messages processed by the brick
are automatically serialized.  That serialization property makes it
much easier to implement immediate commit/abort decisions.  However,
there's a small problem: _disk I/O is slow_.  Here is one example of a
race condition that is caused by slow disk I/O:

1. Assume key `K` does not exist.
2. Client X sends `add(Table, K, Value1)` to brick B.
3. Brick B receives the `add` op.  The key `K` does not exist, so the
operation is permitted.
4. Brick B writes an insert record into its
private write-ahead log and requests a file sync.
5. Brick B is told that the file sync has not yet finished and
therefore cannot send a reply to Client X yet.
6. Client Y sends `add(Table, K, Value2)` to brick B.
7. Brick B receives the `add` op.  The key `K` does not exist, so the
operation is permitted.  _Although key `K` was added in step #4, that
operation's write-ahead log has not yet been flushed safely to disk, so
therefore Brick B cannot yet guarantee that the key does exist._
8. Brick B writes an insert record into its
private write-ahead log and requests a file sync.
9. Brick B is told that the file sync has not yet finished and
therefore cannot send a reply to Client Y yet.
10. Brick B is informed asynchronously that the flush of step #3's
operation is finished.  B sends a reply to Client X of `ok`.
11. Brick B is informed asynchronously that the flush of step #7's
operation is finished.  B sends a reply to Client Y of `ok`.  _This
reply violates the principle of strong consistency and is therefore
incorrect._

Any key that is updated by an operation that is waiting for its
write-ahead log entry to be flushed to disk will have an entry in the
`#state.dirty_tab` ETS table.  When the `fsync(2)` system call is
finished, the key will be removed from `#state.dirty_tab` and the
`#state.ctab` (or the "shadow table", if a checkpoint is in progress)
will be updated to make the key's update visible.

[[micro-transaction-implementation]]
===== Micro-transaction implementation

If a Hibari client calls `do` when the first op in the `DoList` is the
atom `txn`, then the `DoList` will be evaluated as a micro-transaction.
The check is done by `do_do2/3`, with micro-transaction preconditions
checked by `do_txnlist/3`.

If `do_txnlist/3` detects that a micro-transaction precondition has
been violated, e.g. `add` a key that already exists, then an error
accumulator is built to inform the client of which items in `DoList`
failed.  Note that the `txn` op is removed from the `DoList` before
`do_txnlist/3` starts.

If `do_txnlist/3` finds no errors in the micro-transaction, then the
`DoList` is then executed by the same function that processes
non-micro-transaction lists, `do_dolist/4`.

[[log-flushing-and-sync-pid]]
===== Log flushing and the sync pid and the logging_op_q

The management of the write-ahead log and maintaining strong
consistency was a more difficult problem than I had first realized.
To preserve strong consistency, the order of all updates must be
preserved when writing log entries to the write-ahead log.  Updates
come from two sources:

* Client requests
* Chain replication messages, e.g. a log replay message from a brick's
  immediate upstream neighbor.  (NOTE: These messages are handled by
  the `brick_server.erl` module, see xref:brick-server-erl[].)

The brick maintains a monotonically-increasing counter,
`#state.logging_op_serial`, to assign a serial number to each update.
Each update is written in increasing serial number order.  After an
update is written, the brick will request an `fsync(2)` system call on
the log.  The write-ahead log manager will initiate the call (if no
`fsync(2)` call is currently in progress) or queue the request for a
later time (because an `fsync(2)` system call is in progress already).

Because the brick does not know when the `fsync(2)` system call will
finish, the brick stores the operation and its serial number in a
queue called `#state.logging_op_q`.

The write-ahead log manager will notify the brick when an `fsync(2)`
system call is finished, telling the brick the largest serial number
`N`.  The brick will remove all pending requests from the
`#state.logging_op_q` that have serial numbers less than or equal to
serial `N`.  Processing of those pending requests is then resumed.

[[the-syncpid]]
===== The syncpid: How it works, room for improvement

As described above, the "syncpid"'s job is pretty simple:

1. Collect requests for an `fsync(2)` call.  (Each request is tagged
   with a log sequence number.)
2. Now and then, start a `fsync(2)` call via the `gmt_hlog_local.erl`
   API.
3. When the call is finished, notify the brick of the largest log
   sequence number serviced by the completed `fsync(2)` call.

The tricky part is step #2, specifically, when should "now and then"
be?  There are a couple of easy answers to the question:

* Initiate an `fsync(2)` call whenever a single request in step #1
  arrives.  Block all other `fsync(2)` requests until this one
  finishes.
** Both throughput and latency under high load are quite poor.
* Collect requests in step #1 for a fixed amount of time, e.g. 100
  milliseconds, then start `fsync(2)`.
** Throughput under high load is very good, but latency under light
   loads is very high.

The current implementation, in `collect_sync_requests/3`, uses a
variable amount of time in step #1 by waiting a maximum of 5
milliseconds since the last fsync request before going to step #2.
The method is virtuous by being simple and for being "good enough" for
both very low and very high load conditions.

[[value-blobs-on-disk]]
===== Value blob storage on disk: bigdata_dir

As explained in xref:store-tuple[], when a value blob is stored on
disk, its store tuple representation is `{FileNumber::integer(),
Offset::integer()}`.  These two integers are used to find the value
blob's storage location on disk.  See xref:gmt-hlog-erl[] for API
details.

A brick's behavior for value storage is defined by the value of
`#state.bigdata_dir`:

* If `undefined`, then values are stored in RAM, i.e. as an Erlang
  binary within the store tuple.
* If not `undefined`, then values are stored on disk.

When a key is set by a `set`/`add`/`replace` operation in a table that
stores value blobs on disk, there are actually two hunks written to
the brick's write-ahead log:

1. The value blob itself is written in a hunk first.
2. Then the brick's metadata hunk is written second.  This hunk
   contains the store tuple for this key and therefore contains the
   `{FileNumber,Offset}` tuple for the location of the value blob hunk
   stored in step #1.

To retrieve a hunk, the `gmt_hlog` API is used, passing the
`FileNumber` and `Offset` as arguments.  The library function then:

* Converts `FileNumber` to a full file path for the log sequence file.
* Opens the file and seeks to offset `Offset`
* Reads the write-ahead log hunk header, which contains hunk metadata
  such as blob size and MD5 checksum.
* Reads the hunk blob, which immediately follows the hunk header.
** If the client passes the blob size as an extra argument, the two
   reads are combined into a single read request.

[[squid-flash-priming]]
===== Squid/flash and priming

The serial nature of message handling by the "gen_server" behavior is
almost always a good thing.  However, dealing with disk I/O is one of
the few times when it would be really nice to have "gen_server" handle
multiple messages in parallel.

It's certainly possible to have "gen_server" handle multiple messages
in parallel, but it's the developer's responsibility to juggle the
asynchronous replies to clients.  This can get very tricky very
quickly.  However, a logical brick must do this kind of juggling to
minimize latency across all Hibari client requests.

The Erlang virtual machine does not expose an API to the OS's
`mmap(2)` and `mincore(2)` system calls, so it is impossible for a
logical brick to know which parts of a file are in the page cache and
which are not.  Without that knowledge, the brick cannot predict how
long it will take to open or read a log sequence file to retrieve a
value blob.

To make the unpredictable disk I/O pattern into something almost 100%
predictable, Hibari bricks borrow a trick from the
link:http://www.squid-cache.org[Squid HTTP Caching Proxy server] and
the link:http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~vivek/flash/[Flash HTTP
server].  To avoid having computation threads blocked by disk I/O,
both servers use a pool of OS processes or Pthreads whose sole job is
to perform disk I/O.  The model goes something like this:

1. The main server process/thread wishes to read file X.
2. The main server process/thread sends a request to the I/O worker
pool to read X.
3. A process (or thread) in the worker pool opens X, reads X's data,
and closes X.
4. The worker process/thread notifies the main server thread that the
read of X has finished, via a pipe file descriptor.
5. The main server process/thread receives the completion message from
step #4 via the other end of the pipe.
6. Now the main server process/thread can open and read file X with
almost 0% probability that it will be blocked by the OS: it's almost
100% certain that all file system metadata and file data are now in
the OS page cache and therefore the probability of blocking due to
disk I/O is nearly zero.

The logical brick uses the same basic strategy, which I've called
"squid/flash priming" or simply "priming", as in "priming a pump".  A
brick will spawn a short-lived Erlang process to read the log hunk,
notify the main gen_server that the I/O is finished, and then the main
gen_server process can open & read the file with virtual certainty
that it will not be blocked by disk I/O.

Primer processes are used when reading data from a Hibari client `get`
or `get_many` request as well as when reading value blobs during brick
repair operations.  Each has a separate throttle configuration
attribute.

[NOTE]
==================
There is a throttle mechanism to keep too many squid/flash
primer processes from executing simultaneously: the
`brick_primer_limit` attribute in `central.conf`.  Too many primer
processes can cause several problems, separately or in combination
or together:

* Consume too many Erlang processes
* Consume too many OS file descriptors
* Consume too much virtual machine memory
==================

[[refactor-blob-reading]]
[NOTE]
==================
There is plenty of opportunity for refactoring here.  The
current implementation has been "good and fast enough", but there's
almost certainly room for optimization, especially if very large blobs
(greater than 4MB, approximately) are routinely used.  Some possible
optimizations would included:

* Use Erlang NIF functions to use `mmap(2)` and `mincore(2)` system calls.
* Use the `readahead(2)` system call on Linux platforms.  Try to find
  substitutes on other platforms aren't `mmap(2)` and `mincore(2)`.
* Experiment with link:http://libprefetch.cs.ucla.edu/[libprefetch].
* Adding a bytes-per-second throttle for priming operations.
* Perhaps using `mmap(2)` instead of `file:read()` for the final blob
  reading step?
==================

===== Magic values: ?VALUE_REMAINS_CONSTANT, ?VALUE_SWITCHAROO

There are two magic values that an Erlang client can use in a
`set`/`add`/`replace` operation in place of the usual binary or iolist
value blob.

`?VALUE_REMAINS_CONSTANT`::
The client can use this magic constant in an `set`/`add`/`replace`
operation to keep the value blob the same while changing other
attributes of the key, such as expiration time or flags.
`?VALUE_SWITCHAROO`::
Use of this flag is limited to the scavenger only and should not be
used by any other client.  See xref:the-scavenger[] for more.

===== Areas where `brick_server.erl` stuff bleeds over into `brick_ets.erl`

NOTE: These are some areas where logic that most likely should be
moved to `brick_server.erl`.

* Migration sweep logic bleeding into get_many1()
* Chain replication into filter_mods_from_upstream()
* Repair-related stuff in repair_diff_round1()

===== `get_many` and the shadow table

The implementation of the contents table and the shadow table,
`#state.ctab` and `#state.shadowtab` respectively, causes some
problems.  The biggest problem is that when a checkpoint is in
progress and the `#state.shadowtab` exists, then the "does the key
exist?" decision must consult both tables in a sane manner.

The `get_many` operation is most affected by the necessity to look in
both tables.  The `get_many_shadow()` function implements the tricky
logic that's required to combine the contents of both contents and
shadow tables into a consistent set of results.

NOTE: Because `get_many` is really complicated by the shadow table,
and because there has been no hard requirement for a client `get_many`
op that returns keys in reverse order (i.e. search backwards), a
reverse- ordered `get_many` operation does not exist.  There is no
foreseeable technical reason why one couldn't be added.

[[controlling-md5-checksums]]
===== Controlling MD5 checksums

By default, MD5 checksums are generated for all data written to all
write-ahead logs, and those MD5 checksums are checked for all data
read from write-ahead logs.

If the file "disable-md5" exists in the Hibari server data directory,
then data will be written to write-ahead logs without MD5 checksums,
and data read from write-ahead logs will not have MD5 checksums
verified.

If the file "use-md5-bif" exists in the Hibari server data directory,
then the `erlang:md5/1` function will be used to create MD5
checksums.  By default, the `crypto:md5/1` is used to create MD5
checksums.

===== MD5 checksum errors

If an MD5 checksum error is detected, the easy thing to do is crash
the brick.  In practice, this approach causes some additional problems
that we would rather avoid.  The logic is in `bigdata_dir_get_val()`:

* Mark the sequence file as bad.  The assumption is that the entire
  log sequence file is bad.  This assumption may or may not be true,
  but the default is to be conservative.  We don't know if there are
  other checksum errors within the file, so we will:
** Rename the log sequence file to that it cannot be accessed again.
** By not deleting the file, the bad data block(s) in it cannot be
   recycled and therefore contaminate data sometime in the future.
** We can examine the bad file at leisure to confirm that it is bad
   and find any other places where checksums have been corrupted.
** We delete all references to keys that depend on the corrupted log
   sequence file.  Then we crash.  Chain repair will repopulate the
  missing keys.
* Silently drop the entire query.  The client will see a timeout
  eventually and have to retry (if it wishes).

[[the-scavenger]]
===== The scavenger

The "scavenger" procedure is used to reclaim disk space in the "common
log" that is no longer used by a local logical brick.  It is
essentially a copying garbage collector:

1. It determines which hunks in all common log files are currently in
   use or not in use.
2. It perhaps copies some hunks to new log sequence files.
3. It perhaps deletes some log sequence files to reclaim disk space.

IMPORTANT: By default, the scavenger is run once every 24 hours at
03:00.

Each write-ahead log is divided into log sequence files.  Each log
sequence files contains a sequence of "hunks".  The hunks are put into
one of two categories:

* A "live" hunk is still in use, i.e. there is a key which has a value
  blob pointer that points to this hunk.
* A "dead" hunk is not "alive": i.e. the key that originally had a
  value blob pointer to this hunk has since been changed or deleted.

The goal of the scavenger is to reclaim disk space.  The only way to
reclaim disk space is to delete files.  If the scavenger finds a log
sequence file with 0% live hunks, that file can be deleted
immediately.  However, it is quite rare to find a log sequence file
that has 0% live hunks.  For all other log sequence files, a different
strategy is used:

1. Fetch the `brick_skip_live_percentage_greater_than` attribute from
`central.conf`.  Call it `SkipPercent`.
2. For each log sequence file, calculate the ratio of disk space used
by live hunks; call it `LivePercent`.
3. For each log sequence file where `LivePercent` is less than
`SkipPercent`:
** Copy all live hunks to a new log sequence file(s).
** Update the location pointers of those keys to point to the new
   storage locations.
** Delete the old log sequence file.

[[refactor-scavenger]]
NOTE: The current scavenger implementation trades (relatively) low
memory usage for increased execution time and increased disk I/O.
There are probably opportunities to refactor the scavenger to operate
faster or to generate less disk I/O to its temp files.

[[brick-ets-erl-processes]]
===== Processes created by brick_ets.erl

* The long-lived "sync pid" process.  This process is responsible for
  combining, or "batching", multiple brick write operations into a
  single `fsync(2)` OS system call.  Once an `fsync(2)` call has
  finished, the "sync pid" will send a message to the logical brick's
  "gen_server" process to tell it what log items (identified by log
  serial number) have been flushed to disk and can be sent downstream
  and/or to the client.
* The long-lived "local" write-ahead log process.  Each logical brick
  has its own local write-ahead log, managed by its own local log
  process.  This process works together with the "common log"
  write-ahead log and the "sync pid" to store brick updates safely to
  disk.
* Short-lived "checkpoint" processes.  When a brick's local log has
  grown larger than the `brick_check_checkpoint_max_mb` configuration
  variable, a checkpoint process is spawned to perform the checkpoint
  task.  See link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#checkpoints[Hibari
  Sysadmin Guide, "Checkpoints" section] for an overview of the
  checkpoint procedure.
* Very short-lived processes to implement the data "priming" process,
  see above for description.
* A short-lived process to delete keys that have expired.
* Short-lived "scavenger processes, see xref:the-scavenger[].

[[brick-hash-erl]]
==== brick_hash.erl

The consistent hashing layer is the top-level of the layered
abstraction of a Hibari storage cluster, as discussed in
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#hibari-architecture[Hibari Sysadmin
Guide, "Hibari Architecture" section].

The `#hash_r` record encapsulates two things:

* The algorithm used to choose what part of the key will be used for
  hashing: the entire key, fixed length prefix, variable length
  prefix, etc.
* The consistent hashing algorithm itself.

The `#g_hash_r` record is the "global hash record" for a table.  It is
the record that is "spammed" to all brick servers and clients (see the
xref:spamming-the-global-hash[description of global hash spamming]).
The `#g_hash_r` record contains the `#hash_r` records for:

* The current hash configuration
* The new hash configuration.

Usually, the current hash config is the same as the new hash config.
However, when chains are added/removed/reweighted and a data migration
takes place, the new hash configuration is used to determine which
keys stay in their current chain and which need to be moved to a new
chain.

In theory, all Hibari clients have access to an up-to-date copy of
each tables' `#g_hash_r` record, via their node-local `brick_simple`
server.  In practice, due to message passing latencies, all clients do
not have correct global hashes 100% of the time.  The Admin Server
also sends `#g_hash_r` updates to all server bricks also.  If a client
is using an old global hash, the servers (using the same consistent
hash calculations) can forward the request to the correct brick.

===== Key hashing methods

The only method that should be used for new Hibari tables is the
`chash` method.  The other three, `naive`, ``var_prefix`, and
`fixed_prefix`, are deprecated and will be removed at some point.  The
`chash` method supports all three schemes and also provides
migration-related features that the three deprecated schemes alone
cannot.

===== Initializing a `chash`

See the EDoc entry for `chash_init/3` for full details on all the
valid properties that can be passed in the 3rd argument proplist.

The two properties that are mandatory are `prefix_method` and
`new_chainweights`.  We strongly advise that you also include the
`old_float_map` property; the float map can be extracted from a
`#g_hash_r` or a `#hash_r` record using the
`chash_extract_new_float_map/1` function.

IMPORTANT: Do not use the `chash_extract_old_float_map/1` function to
extract the consistent hash "float map" from the current global hash
record.  In the context of the current global hash, the "old float
map" is the float map used from the global hash _prior to the current
one_, which is almost certainly not the float map you want when making
a new global hash record.

===== Checking data migration pattern before initiating migration

The chain changing example in xref:changing-chains-example[] shows how
to verify that the `#hash_r` that you've created will result in the
key distribution across chains that you desire.  See the
xref:chash-migration-pre-check[example of using ``brick_simple:chash_migration_pre_check/2`].

[[brick-itimer-erl]]
===== brick_itimer.erl

Older versions of Hibari made substantial use of
`timer:send_interval/2` for sending periodic timer messages.  The
`timer` module's implementation can be too inefficient when over 1,000
separate timer interval requests are made.  The `brick_itimer` module
creates a more CPU-efficient implementation for heavily used timer
intervals, for example 1 second.

The latency jitter in delivering these shared timer messages is
intentional.  Strict real-time accuracy for sending these periodic
messages is not required.  If stricter delivery timings are required,
do not use this module.

[[brick-mboxmon-erl]]
==== brick_mboxmon.erl

Hibari servers use asynchronous message passing in two major areas:

* Chain replication: sending events "downstream" to the next brick in
  a chain.
* Chain repair: sending key updates to bricks that have crashed and
  later restarted.

The number of these asynchronous messages can arrive more quickly than
a brick can handle.  Perhaps its CPU is overloaded, or perhaps disk
I/O rates are so high that the hardware cannot provide adequate
service times.  In either case, the number of messages in a logical
brick "gen_server" process mailbox can grow too large.

It is vital for good performance that a brick's mailbox.  Large
mailboxes can interfere with other messaging, for example, synchronous
calls to the brick's write-ahead log process.  If the mailbox grows
too large, the VM will spend 100% of a CPU core performing selective
`receive` operations on the mailbox.  If the mailbox continues to grow
without limit, the entire VM can crash by consuming all virtual memory
available to the OS.

If a brick's mailbox gets too big, then some kind of "pressure"
mechanism is required to slow down message producers.  In cases of
mailbox overload during brick repair, repair operations by the
upstream brick (with the "official tail" role) must slow down.  In
normal chain operations, the head brick must slow down its rate of
updates.

The throttling mechanism implemented by `brick_mboxmon.erl` is
straightforward.  Every 500 milliseconds, the mailbox size of each
brick on the local node is polled via `erlang:process_info/2`.

* If the mailbox size exceeds the `brick_mbox_repair_high_water`
  attribute in `central.conf`, and if the brick is under repair, then
  the throttle mechanism is activated.
** The repair process is stopped and will be restarted in
  `brick_mbox_repair_overload_resume_interval` seconds.
* If the mailbox size exceeds the `brick_mbox_high_water` attribute in
  `central.conf`, then the throttle mechanism is activated.
** The head brick in the chain is flipped to "read-only mode".  When
   in read-only mode, the head brick cannot process any updates, so
   the head brick cannot create new key updates that will eventually
   be sent to the overloaded brick.
* When the overloaded brick's mailbox size falls under
  `brick_mbox_low_water`, then the brick is no longer considered
  overloaded.
** In cases of repair overload, repair is restarted.
** In cases of normal chain replication overload, the head brick's
   "read-only status" is turned off (i.e. updates are permitted
   again).  For transient overload conditions lasting 0-3 seconds,
   client request buffering by the head brick is usually sufficient to
   avoid timeouts visible by Hibari clients.  However, if the chain is
   so overloaded that client timeouts occur, then the client timeout
   mechanism itself will reduce the chain's total workload.

The application log files on the overloaded brick, the head brick, and
(in repair cases) the Admin Server will contain messages stating when
and why the brick was considered overloaded and when the overload
condition ended.

[[brick-migmon-erl]]
==== brick_migmon.erl

During times when a table's chain configuration is changed
(e.g. chains added, removed, or reweighted), a "data migration" takes
place.  Some keys are copied, or "migrated", from one chain to
another.  The `brick_migmon.erl` module is responsible for monitoring
the overall status of this data migration period.

Data migrations are tied closely to a table's global hash record.
Each Hibari table has its own global hash record (`#g_hash_r`
record).  It is therefore possible to have multiple migrations running
simultaneously for multiple tables.

However, each data migration for a global hash is assigned a "cookie",
which is an opaque Erlang term.  In the event that some or all
processes in the Admin Server crash, this cookie is used to
distinguish between resuming an in-progress migration and starting a
new migration.  If migrations are numbered _X_, _X+1+_, _X+2_, etc.,
then a migration _X+1_ for table _Y_ will not be permitted to start
until migration _X_ for table _Y_ has finished.

[[brick-migmon-sup-erl]]
==== brick_migmon_sup.erl

This is a supervisor dedicated to `brick_migmon` processes.

[[brick-pingee-erl]]
==== brick_pingee.erl

Earlier versions of Hibari had difficulty with brick "pinger"
processes getting timeouts when trying to check a logical brick's
health.  Under extremely high workloads, the first-come, first-served
nature of a "gen_server"'s message handling was not sufficient.

The solution is to create a separate "pingee" process for each logical
brick.  As the main brick "gen_server" process makes major state
transitions, those transitions are transmitted to the "pingee"
process.  The "pinger" processes actually communicate with the
"pingee" process for health inquiries and not with the main brick
process.  Because the "pingee" is only used for state transition and
health check messages, its mailbox is almost always empty, and its
process almost always idle.  This combination helps make responses to
health checks much quicker.

[[refactor-pingee]]
NOTE: The split between the main brick process and the "pingee"
process does not eliminate timeouts under extremely heavy workloads.
There may be useful refactoring work possible here.  The main source
of latency appears to be during inter-node messaging congestion,
e.g. when 'dist_port_busy' system events are generated.

[[brick-sb-erl]]
==== brick_sb.erl

This module implements the Admin Server's "scoreboard" process.  The
scoreboard reflects the health status of each logical brick and chain.

Accelerate read-only query performance, all scoreboard status is
maintained in RAM.  To make the scoreboard resilient in case of
crashing, each status change is synchronously written to the Admin
Server's private `bootstrap_copy`* bricks.  See
xref:admin-server-crash-recovery[] for more info on crash-recovery
design.  For more information about the Admin Server's bootstrap
bricks, see link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#bootstrap-bricks[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Admin Server's Private State: the Bootstrap Bricks"
section] and
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#bricks-outside-chain-replication[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Bricks outside of chain replication" section].

Each status change event that is sent to the scoreboard includes a
proplist that can contain additional information about the event.  At
this time, there is no requirement of mandatory properties in that
proplist.  Though mandatory properties may be introduced later, the
main purpose is merely to provide a human developer/systems
administrator with some extra information about the event.

.Scoreboard and it's surrounding (partial) supervision tree
svgimage::images/brick-sb-stree[align="center"]

The scoreboard and it's surrounding (partial) supervision tree is
depicted above by "dotted" lines.  The chainmon_XXX and pinger_YYY
processes manually establish a link with the brick_sb process.  If a
"down event" for the brick_sb processed is received, the chainmon_XXX
and pinger_YYY processes sleep for 1 second before exiting abnormally.
The brick_mon_sup supervisor will then automatically restart the
chainmon_XXX and pinger_YYY processes.

.Scoreboard and it's surrounding (partial) call tree
svgimage::images/brick-sb-ctree[align="center"]

During initialization of the scoreboard, the brick_sb loads the
``scoreboard'' operational history into RAM from the bootstrap bricks
via the brick_admin server.  After initialization, the brick_sb
manages the state in RAM and synchronously writes the full state
directly to the bootstrap bricks after receiving new chain and/or
brick status reports.  To help improve performance, the implementation
of the brick_sb is optimized to process all pending status reports as
a batch and to then save the full state to the bootstrap bricks as a
single write operation.

IMPORTANT: The scoreboard's maximum length of the list of historical
events is hard-coded at 100.  This should be changed to use a
`central.conf` configuration attribute instead.

[[refactor-scoreboard]]
[NOTE]
=================================
If the Admin Server is refactored to enhance performance, then
the scoreboard will likely be one of the first items fixed.  Because
all state changes must be reported to the scoreboard, and the
scoreboard synchronous writes each change to the bootstrap bricks, the
scoreboard is can be a substantial performance bottleneck in a cluster
that contains thousands of logical bricks.
=================================

[[brick-server-erl]]
==== brick_server.erl

The `brick_server.erl` module implements the storage-agnostic aspects
of a logical brick.  It isn't fully insulated from matters related to
ETS and disk write-ahead log, but it's close.  See the beginning of
xref:brick-ets-erl[] for more details of how `brick_ets.erl` started
and how `brick_server.erl` came along later.

[[brick-server-matroshka]]
===== "gen_server" nested inside a "gen_server", Matroshka-style

See also xref:brick-ets-matroshka[].

After the split of `brick_ets.erl` and `brick_server.erl`, the
"gen_server" callback functions of both were preserved, even though
both are used by a single process.  As far as OTP is concerned,
`brick_server.erl` is the callback module used for the main logical
brick gen_server process.  If a call, cast, or message isn't handled
by `brick_server`'s callback function, then the message is handled by
`brick_ets`'s callback function.

The wrinkle in this otherwise flawless scheme is that
`brick_server.erl` has to maintain the `#state` record that
`brick_ets.erl` uses, keeping it completely separate from
`brick_server.erl`'s record of the same name.

[[refactor-logging-op-q]]
NOTE: The `brick_server` `#state` record is pretty simple, compared to
`brick_ets`'s, and much smaller.  Note that `brick_server`'s `#state`
record also contains a `logging_op_q` member, which is used for a
similar purpose as `brick_ets`'s.  Maintaining two separate queues of
log entries is quite messy.  It would be really tricky to refactor
without breaking anything, but the effort would be worthwhile.

[[do-ops-op-flags-do-flags]]
===== Making `do` operations, operation flags, and `do` flags

See xref:do-api-via-brick-simple[] for examples that use the `do()`
client interface.

All of the basic `do` operations are encoded into a small number of
tuples.  See `make_op2()`, `make_op5()`, and `make_op6()`.  Note that
if you want to manage your own timestamps, rather than use ones based
on the OS system clock, you must use the `make_op6()` function
yourself.  A more convenient API doesn't yet exist because there's
been no need for it ... but it would be easy & quick to write.

By default, the various operations within a `do` call's `DoList` do
not have any transaction semantics.  If a `DoList` contains 5
operations, then there is almost no difference between sending that
`DoList` to a server than there is sending 5 different `do`
operations, each containing a single op.  However...

... there are two good reasons why an application developer might want
to combine those 5 ops into a single `do` call:

* To reduce the total amount of time required to process the 5 ops.
* To take advantage of the brick's guarantee that no other ops (sent
  by another client) can be interleaved with the execution of those 5 ops.
** Note that this guarantee is not the same as the guarantees provided
   by micro-transactions.

There are two types of flags that can be sent with a `do` op:

* Flags bundled in the `make_op`* function, which affect only that
  particular operation.
** See the EDoc description of `encode_op_flags/1` for valid op flag
   names.
* Flags that affect all ops in the `do` list.
** See the EDoc description of `do/5` for valid `DoFlags` names.

===== Disk logging and log flush options

The Admin Server maintains the table-specific settings for disk
logging and log flush parameters for all bricks in the table.  By
default, both disk logging and log flushing are enabled.  Both
features are actually implemented by `brick_ets.erl`, but the API to
change those parameters at runtime are handled through
`brick_server.erl`.

See `set_do_logging/2` and `set_do_sync`.

===== Brick role management

The role management functions were designed for use by the Admin
Server to manage the brick lifecycle state machine.  See comment
"Chain admin & related API" in `-export` statements at top of the
file.

See link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#brick-lifecycle-fsm[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Brick Lifecycle Finite State Machine" section] for
a description of a brick's lifecycle within chain replication.

[[refactor-role-management]]
NOTE: When a brick's role is set, the brick knows at most its
immediate upstream brick and its immediate downstream brick.  Most of
the time, this decision works well.  However, occasionally it's useful
for a brick to know all members of its chain, e.g. when the
`brick_mboxmon` needs to signal the head brick to slow down.  These
cases haven't happened often enough to trigger a refactoring, but it
might be useful later.

Management of the `#chain_r` record is tricky whenever a role is
changed.  There are some attributes of the record that should be reset
to a default value and other attributes that must be preserved.
Examples of the latter are log serial numbers used by the brick as
well as serial numbers ack'ed downstream & upstream.  Some role
transitions must also be reflected in the `brick_pingee` helper
process (see xref:brick-pingee-erl[]).  The result looks more complex
than you'd first believe is necessary, but there isn't much excess
code to remove: much of that complexity is necessary.

===== Consistent hashing is enforced by brick servers, `do` forwarding

As described in xref:brick-hash-erl[], the `brick_hash.erl` module is
used for consistent hashing calculations by Hibari clients.  However,
because a client may be acting on old/stale data, each Hibari brick
also uses `brick_hash` to verify that each operation it receives
should be executed locally.

If a client sends a `do` call to the wrong brick, as calculated by the
brick's global hash, then that brick will forward the `do` call to
what it believes is the correct brick.  However, due to asynchronous
message passing, scheduling latencies, network latencies, etc., the
_brick itself_ may have an old/stale version of the global hash.  In
such a case, the `do` will be forwarded to the wrong brick.  However,
because each brick will forward the `do` to where it believes the `do`
should go, eventually the `do` call will arrive at its proper
location.  In the event that the forwarding takes too long, the client
will see a timeout.

The forwarding mechanism is limited by a couple of factors:

* Each forwarding increments a forwarding hop counter.
* After the first few forwarding hops, a geometrically-increasing
  sleep period is used before actual forwarding.
* After a limit of 18 forwarding hops, the query is dropped.

Each time the `do` call is forwarded, the `SentAt` time (which is
originally set by the client node) is reset to the current wall-clock
time.  This reset is done to prevent `brick_do_op_too_old_timeout`
configuration attribute enforcement; see
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#ntp-config-strongly-recommended[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "NTP configuration of all Hibari server and client
nodes" section].

===== Chain replication protocol messages and sending client replies

See link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#chain-lifecycle-fsm[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "Chain Lifecycle Finite State Machine" section] for
background information.

Both chain replication protocol messages and client replies are sent
"downstream", i.e. they are sent to the next brick in the chain.

The reply term for a `do` call is piggy-backed onto the chain
replication message that is sent down the chain.  When a chain
replication protocol message reaches a brick has the "official tail"
role, then:

* The reply is sent to the client.
* If the brick has a downstream brick (i.e. there is a brick currently
  under repair that is downstream of the "official tail" brick), then
  the chain replication protocol message is sent downstream.

If the `do` operation has the `ignore_role` property in its `DoFlags`
property list, then the reply is sent directly to the client (instead
of the default behavior of being sent downstream with the chain
replication message).

The chain replication protocol messages are:

`{ch_log_replay, UpstreamBrick, Serial, Thisdo_Mods, From, Reply}`::
The `UpstreamBrick` and `Serial` terms are used to verify that the
message comes from the correct brick and that messages have not been
sent out-of-order.  The `Thisdo_Mods` term contains the write-ahead
log terms associated with this update (i.e. insert and delete
commands), and `From` and `Reply` are used to send the `Reply` term to
the client.
+
`{ch_serial_ack, Serial, BrickName, Node, Props}`::
Once per second, the tail brick sends this message upstream.  All
other bricks in the chain forward it upstream until it reaches the
head brick.  All bricks in the chain keep track of the `Serial` number
in these messages and purge from their in-memory buffers all log
replay requests with serial numbers less than or equal to `Serial`:
these replay requests are no longer required to recover from failure
of a middle brick.

===== Write-ahead log sequence number complications

See xref:log-flushing-and-sync-pid[] for background on the write-ahead
log serial number's use and management.

[[refactor-wal]]
[NOTE]
======================
Of all the complications that were introduced by the separation
of the `brick_ets.erl` and `brick_server.erl` modules, the largest
source of nasty, hard-to-find bugs has been management of the
write-ahead log queues, the `#state.logging_op_q` term in both
modules' state record.  Refactoring this log management would probably
help performance by reducing CPU consumption as well as making the
core server code less fragile.

One area that might be easier to refactor is the management of the
serial number associated with each queue.  Incrementing the serial
number is done by the caller after writing something to the queue.  It
would likely be much less error-prone if the writing and the
incrementing were done by the same call.
======================

There is a lot of code in `chain_send_downstream_iff_empty_log_q/6`
and elsewhere to make certain that log events are sent downstream
without violating ordering constraints.  I confess it isn't pretty,
but all of the bugs that I know of have been wrung out.  If there are
still bugs (and I suspect but cannot prove that there is one more),
the paranoid sanity checking done by the downstream/receiving brick
will crash if `Serial` numbers are received out-of-order.  It isn't a
pretty way to recover from such an error, but it's the safest reaction
that I know of.

===== Chain repair protocol messages

The chain repair protocol has been implemented twice.  The first
protocol was a brute-force, "as simple as possible" affair.  The
upstream brick would send a series of `{ch_repair, Serial,
RepairList}` messages to the repairing brick.  `RepairList` contained
a list of store tuples (see xref:store-tuple[]) for all keys in the
table.  Note that these store tuples will always contain the full
value blob.

The first protocol was deprecated after it became clear that "as
simple as possible" had too much overhead.  When in-RAM storage of
value blobs was the only option, then it was cheap to fetch the value
blobs and send them across the network to the repairing brick.  But
when "bigdata" storage was introduced (see
xref:value-blobs-on-disk[]), then the disk I/O, network bandwidth, and
total latency became far too high to be practical.

The second chain repair protocol uses two rounds of messages to avoid
the I/O problems caused by the first protocol:

1. First round: The upstream sends a list of keys, a
subset of all keys stored by the brick.  The downstream replies with
the list of keys that it does not have copies of.
2. Second round: If the downstream does not need any keys, this round
is skipped.  Otherwise, the upstream sends the downstream the store
tuples (including value blob) for only the keys that the client
requested in round 1.

The following messages are exchanged:

`{ch_repair_diff_round1, Serial, RepairList}`::
The 1st round message sent by the upstream brick.  Only key and
timestamps are included in `RepairList`.
+
`{ch_repair_diff_round1_ack, Serial, BrickName, Node, Unknown, Ds}`::
This is the downstream brick's response to the
`{ch_repair_diff_round1, ...}` message.  The `Unknown` term is a list
of keys that are missing from the downstream brick (completely missing
or timestamp mismatch).  The `Ds` informs the upstream brick of how
many keys were deleted by the downstream brick.
+
If the brick's value blobs are stored on disk, then an asynchronous
"priming" mechanism is used by the upstream brick to force those blobs
into RAM before processing sending the 2nd round.
+
`{ch_repair_diff_round2, Serial, RepairList, Ds}`::
The upstream brick sends this message with `RepairList` containing all
store tuples (with value blobs) for all keys requested in round 1.
The `Ds` term is not used.
+
`{ch_repair_ack, Serial, BrickName, Node, Inserted, Deleted}`::
The downstream brick sends this message in both the old and new repair
protocol versions.  `Inserted` and `Deleted` count the number of keys
that were inserted and deleted into the repairing brick, respectively.
+
`{ch_repair_finished, Brick, Node, Checkpoint_p, NumKeys}`::
The upstream brick sends this message when the round 1 messages have
iterated over all keys.  When received, the downstream brick will move
itself from the `repairing` state to the `ok` state.  The brick
"pinger" process will notice this state transition and trigger further
chain role changes.

While these repair protocol messages are exchanged, the upstream brick
will send all `{ch_log_replay,...}` chain replication messages as
updates occur.  On the upstream brick, the `{ch_repair_diff_round1,
Serial, RepairList}` is created without interference from client
updates; any keys not in `RepairList` are immediately deleted by the
downstream brick before replying with the
`{ch_repair_diff_round1_ack,...}` message.  Therefore, any possible
race conditions involving client updates of keys within the
`RepairList` range of keys are resolved correctly by the log serial
mechanism, because only one of two races can happen inside the
upstream brick:

* The client update `{ch_log_replay,...}` message is sent before the
  upstream creates and sends the round 1 repair message.  Any keys
  updated in the log replay message are guaranteed to be included in
  the round 1 repair message.
* The client update `{ch_log_replay,...}` message is sent after the
  upstream creates and sends the round 1 repair message.  Any keys
  updated in the log replay message are guaranteed to not be included
  in the round 1 repair message.  Replay of the replay message can
  happen safely at any time (as long as serial number ordering is
  preserved).

===== Data migration protocol messages

The data migration mechanism is used to move keys from one chain to
another when chains are added, removed, or reweighted.  The task of
moving keys while maintaining strong consistency is a delicate
business.  The protocol, which uses two rounds (or phases), described
below is used to move keys safely between chains.

During migration, the head of each chain maintains a "sweep key
pointer".  This pointer moves through the keys, first to last (in
lexicographic sorting order).

* Keys that are "in front" of the sweep
key, i.e. keys that are larger than the sweep key, have not yet been
scanned by the migration algorithm.
* Keys that are "behind" the sweep key, i.e. keys that are smaller
than the sweep key, have been scanned by the migration algorithm.

The sweep key advances through the head brick's keys, advancing by a
maximum of `max_keys_per_iter` configuration attributed in
`central.conf` or a maximum of 64MB of blob values (hardcoded for now
in `get_sweep_tuples/4`.  These keys are what the code calls the
"sweep zone": those keys between the sweep key's current value and the
sweep key's value from the last successful iteration of the migration
protocol.

`{ch_log_replay,...}` message with `{plog_sweep,phase1_sweep_info,#sweepcheckp_r}` modification inside::
If the chain length is > 1, the head brick must inform all bricks in
the chain where the new sweep key is located.  For chains of length 1,
this first phase is not required.  All bricks record the sweep info in the
`sweepcheckp_r` record into its private brick metadata: the head brick
before sending the message, all other bricks when receiving the
message.  The private metadata is used to recover vital state in case
the head brick crashes.  NOTE: This migration sweep metadata is called
a sweep checkpoint and is not related to a brick key checkpoint.
`{sweep_phase1_done,LastKey}`::
Sent by the tail of the chain back to the head, acknowledging that all
bricks in the chain have seen the `{plog_sweep,phase1_sweep_info,...}`
message.
`{ch_sweep_from_other, ChainHeadPid, ChainName, Thisdo_Mods, LastKey}`::
This message starts the second phase of migration.  The head brick has
calculated which keys must be moved to a new chain.  This message is
sent to the head of the new chain.  The `Thisdo_Mods`
contains the list of store tuples that are moving to the receiving
brick; this list is sent down the chain using the usual chain
replication protocol.  `LastKey` specifies where the sweep key
location for the `ChainName` chain.  One of these messages will be
sent to each chain that stores keys within the sweep zone; call the
number of chains _X_.
`{sweep_phase2_done, Key, PropList}`::
When the modifications from the second phase's
`{ch_sweep_from_other,...}` message have reached the tail of the new
chain, this message is sent to the head of the old chain to
acknowledge that the migrated keys are now fully replicated on the new
chain.  When the head brick receives `{ch_sweep_from_other,...}`
messages from all _X_ chains, then the second phase of migration is
finished.

===== Data migration mechanism and value blob "priming"

In between round 1 and round 2 of a migration sweep iteration, the
same value blob "priming" technique is used to prevent disk I/O from
blocking the brick's gen_server process.  See `sweep_move_or_keep/3`
and `spawn_val_prime_worker_for_sweep/3`.

===== SSF: The server-side fun, client side

"SSF" stands for "Server-Side Fun".  An SSF is an Erlang fun that is
created by a Hibari client and executed on a Hibari server brick.  The
SSF has the ability to rewrite the `DoList` of operations in the `do`
call based on the ability to examine the brick's internal state.

In the end, the SSF cannot do anything that cannot be done with
multiple queries to a brick.  For example, here is a simple two-query
scheme to update simple counter value in a race-safe manner:

.Incrementing a counter
--------------------------
{ok, TS, OldValBin} = brick_simple:get(TableName, Key),
OldVal = binary_to_term(OldValBin),
ok = brick_simple:replace(TableName, Key, term_to_binary(OldVal + 1),
                          [{testset, TS}]),
%% Use OldVal in code below this point.
--------------------------

An SSF would use a very similar bit of logic and would create the same
`replace` operation.

.Incrementing a counter with an SSF
--------------------------
F = fun(Key, _DoOp, _DoFlags, S) ->
      [{_Key, TS, Val, _Exp, _KeyFlags}] = brick_server:ssf_peek(Key, true, S),
      OldVal = binary_to_term(Val),
      {ok, [brick_server:make_replace(Key, term_to_binary(OldVal + 1), 0,
                                      [{testset, TS}]),
            {current_val, OldVal}]}
    end,
Op = brick_server:make_ssf(Key, F),
[ok, {current_val, OldVal}] = brick_server:do(TableName, [op]),
%% Use OldVal in code below this point.
--------------------------

The SSF fun creates a list of `do` primitive operations, in this case
two operations:

* A `replace` operation to update the key
* A "pass-through" 2-tuple to tell the client the current value of the
  counter.  Because this 2-tuple isn't a valid brick operation, the
  term is returned to the client as-is.

Here is an example that uses the SSF above.  It assumes that the shell
variable `F` has been bound to the fun above.  A cut-and-paste of the
code above will work well, assuming that `F` is not already bound to a
shell variable and that the final "end," is replaced with "end.".

  (hibari_dev@bb3)13> brick_simple:set(tab1, "c1", term_to_binary(0)).
  ok

  (hibari_dev@bb3)14> Op = brick_server:make_ssf("c1", F).
  {ssf,<<"c1">>,[#Fun<erl_eval.4.105156089>]}

  (hibari_dev@bb3)15> brick_simple:do(tab1, [Op]).
  [ok,{current_val,0}]

  (hibari_dev@bb3)16> brick_simple:do(tab1, [Op]).
  [ok,{current_val,1}]

[IMPORTANT]
======================
The SSF is executed to create a list of `do` primitive
operations.  All attempts to examine brick keys must be done using the
`brick_server:ssf_peek/3` function.  The `brick_server:ssf_peek/3`
cannot guarantee that the key will not be modified immediately after
the `ssf_peek/3` call and the actual execution of the `DoList` created
by the SSF.

For example, here is a case where the timestamp of the key has been
modified in a race with another client.  Note that the 2nd element in
the return term, `{current_val, N}`, is included in the results
despite the error.  The client must perform sufficient pattern
matching and/or other sanity checks to verify that the SSF and its
`DoList` output were successful.

  (hibari_dev@bb3)21> brick_simple:do(tab1, [Op2]).
  [{ts_error,1272654442441669},{current_val,2}]
======================

NOTE: The API of the SSF is a work-in-progress.  It is used by one
internal Gemini project but otherwise does not have strong
backward-compatibility requirements.

===== SSF: The server-side fun, server side

NOTE: The API of the SSF is a work-in-progress.  It is used by one
internal Gemini project but otherwise does not have strong
backward-compatibility requirements.

The implementation of SSFs (server-side funs) on the server side of
the world is an experiment using a general framework for modifying
`do` operations on the client side before they are executed.  This
experiment is implemented by the combination of:

* The `brick_preprocess_method` configuration attributed in
  `central.conf`.
* The `handle_call_do/3` and `preprocess_fold/4` functions.
* Individual functions in the `#state.do_list_preprocess` list.

The current implementation allows the output of the SSF to replace the
{ssf, Key, Fun} tuple inside the `do` call's `DoList` list of
operations.  It does not permit the arbitrary modification of the
entire `DoList` list, nor does it permit examination of other
operations in the `DoList`.  The reasoning for the limitation is that
all `DoList` items ultimately come from a single client in a single
`do` operation; if the client wanted to reorder things arbitrarily,
the client has the power to do that before sending the `do` call.

===== MD5 checksum errors in the write-ahead log

When an MD5 checksum error is detected by `brick_ets.erl` or one of
the write-ahead log modules, dealing with the error is a bit complex:

* Data structures maintained by `brick_ets.erl` require changes.
* The error may be inside a file in the "common log", the part
  of the write-ahead log shared by all bricks on the node.  In this
  case, all bricks must be notified that a file in the common log is
  bad.

The `common_log_sequence_file_is_bad/3` function is used by
`gmt_hlog_common.erl` to notify each brick when an MD5 checksum error
is found.

===== Checkpoint options

The checkpoint operation is implemented by `brick_ets.erl`, but the
API options are documented in the EDoc for
`brick_server:checkpoint/3`.

See xref:brick-ets-erl-ets-tables[] and xref:brick-ets-erl-processes[]
for more information information about checkpointing.

===== Scavenger options

The implementation of the scavenger is spread across both
two modules.  As a general rule, the low-level key scanning and hunk
copying is done by functions in `brick_ets.erl`, while the
higher-level coordination is implemented in `gmt_hlog_common.erl`.

One property worth noting here is the `destructive` option.  If this
property is false, then the scavenger will read keys but not do
anything to relocate the keys.  When used in combination with
`{skip_live_percentage_greater_than,100}`, the scavenger can verify
the MD5 checksums of all value blobs by reading all value blob hunks
in sorted, log file sequence order.

The scavenger can be halted manually using
`gmt_hlog_common:stop_scavenger_commonlog/0` and resumed using
`gmt_hlog_common:resume_scavenger_commonlog/2`.

[[scavenger-and-code-reuse]]
===== Scavenger and code reuse

One of the design ideas behind the scavenger is that it should try to
avoid random I/O as much as possible.  The scavenger uses the same
write-ahead log as everyone else, and since the write-ahead log always
uses sequential file writes and does a decent job of batching multiple
writes with a fewer number of `fsync(2)` calls, write I/O is mostly
sequential.  However, the scavenger's read I/O should also be as
sequential as possible ... so the scavenger goes through a lot of
effort to read all hunks from a single log file at the same time and
in sequential offset order.

[[fast-sync]]
===== Fast sync

The sequential read property introduced at
xref:scavenger-and-code-reuse[] can be useful in other areas also.
For example, the "fast sync" utility in `brick_admin.erl`.

The utility is intended for use in cases where a very large brick has
had a catastrophic failure, and all data on that brick is lost.  The
chain replication algorithm will perform repair based on key
lexicographic sort order.  The key sorting order is not correlated with
storage location within the common log.  The result is disk read I/O
patterns that are mostly random, meaning it could take days to fully
repair a brick that had lost many terabytes of data.

The "fast sync" utility uses the scavenger's infrastructure to sort
live keys into log sequence and offset order (instead of lexicographic
order).  Ideally, this changes the read I/O pattern on the repairing
brick to be more sequential than random.  Once the "fast sync" utility
is finished, then usual chain replication is used to fix discrepancies
caused by updates made while the "fast sync" was running.

[[brick-shepherd-erl]]
==== brick_shepherd.erl

The brick shepherd "gen_server" is the public interface for
adding/removing logical bricks to/from the `brick_brick_sup`
supervisor.

For testing purposes, the functions `add_do_not_restart_brick/2` and
`delete_do_not_restart_brick/2` allow developers and test scripts to
crash a brick and prevent their prompt restart.

[[brick-simple-erl]]
==== brick_simple.erl

The `brick_simple.erl` module provides three sets of services for
Hibari clients and administrators.

* An easy-to-use client API to fetch and update key/value data in a
  Hibari cluster.
* A "gen_server" that runs on each Hibari client node that receives
  cluster status updates from the Hibari Admin Server.  This server,
  with the registered name `brick_simple`, runs as part of both the
  `gdss` and `gdss_client` OTP applications.
* A handful of hash-related utility functions useful for Hibari
  administrators.

Each client API call, e.g. `add()`, `get_many()`, needs to query the
`brick_simple` server as prerequisite of the consistent hashing
calculation and `{TableName, Key}` -> chain mapping.  The Erlang
process dictionary is (ab)used to improve performance by reducing the
size of replies sent by `brick_simple`.

[[refactor-brick-simple]]
NOTE: Parts of the exported API for this module may seem cumbersome to
use.  Those parts are from a bottom-up code writing experiment that
created only exported APIs needed for very specific tasks, not to
create a more useful (generally-speaking) interface.  A refactoring
exercise could be useful here.

NOTE: The `fold_table()` API functions are not fully robust in cases
where bricks fail or when a data migration is in progress.  If a
robust full-table fold is required, then another implementation is
required.

[[brick-squorum-erl]]
==== brick_squorum.erl

This is a simplified quorum-based replication client for Hibari server
bricks.  See xref:brick-admin-erl[] for background and
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#admin-server-app[Hibari Sysadmin
Guide, "The Admin Server Application" section] for background info.

[[refactor-brick-squorum]]
NOTE: "Simplified" means that it's meant for use only within the Admin
Server and should not be used (in its current form) by other
applications.  It should be straightforward enough to maintain
compatibility with the Admin Server while refactoring to add some
missing robustness features, e.g. client-side repair when
inconsistencies are detected in 100% of use cases.

The intent of this module is provide naive and simple yet robust
storage for use by an cluster admin/manager server.  Such a server
has limited requirements for persistent data, but it doesn't make
sense to store that data on a local disk.  For availability, that
data should be spread across multiple bricks.  However, there's a
chicken-and-the-egg problem for a cluster manager: if the cluster
must be running in order to serve data, how do you start the
cluster?

The answer (for now) is to have any machine capable of running an
administrator to have a statically configured list of bricks that
store cluster manager data.  A very simple quorum technique is used
for robust storage.

No transaction support is provided, since we assume that the
manager will use some other mechanism for preventing multiple
managers from running simultaneously.

The Admin Server uses the `Schema.local` file as a hint for breaking
the chicken-and-egg problem of finding the bootstrap bricks.  The
bricks listed in `Schema.local` are consulted to try to find a valid
`#schema_r` record.  Once a copy of that record is found, then the
real list of bootstrap bricks in `#schema_r.schema_bricklist` is used
for all subsequent quorum calculations.

[[brick-sup-erl]]
==== brick_sup.erl

This is the top-level supervisor for the `gdss` Hibari application.

[[brick-ticket-erl]]
==== brick_ticket.erl

The `brick_ticket.erl` module implements a subset of functionality of
another Gemini application.  It provides ticket-based workload
limiting services, sometimes called "admission-based rate limiting".

The goal is to limit the amount of _X_ things that can happen per unit
of time, e.g. executing a function per minute or reading a maximum
number of bytes/second.

Hibari bricks use this ticket-based system to provide shared
throttling mechanisms for checkpoint and scavenger operations.  Via
`central.conf`, both activities are limited to a certain amount of
write bandwidth per second.

[[gmt-hlog-erl]]
==== gmt_hlog.erl

See link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#write-ahead-logs[Hibari Sysadmin
Guide, "Write-Ahead Logs" section] for background info.

The Erlang/OTP `disk_log` library does not support random access into
one of its log files.  Hibari's on-disk value blob storage requires
very efficient random access to the write-ahead log.  Therefore,
`disk_log` wasn't sufficient.

I came close to using a bridge to Berkeley DB to use only the Berkeley
DB logging subsystem.  But I discovered some tough problems around the
edges of the that subsystem, and I abandoned the idea.  I don't
recall what issue(s) it was, but I recall it was related to a
not-so-clean separation between the logging subsystem and another DB
system when the log was opened?

The basic concept for this module is stolen from the Berkeley DB
logging subsystem.  DB's logging subsystem allows you to append a hunk
to a log.  In return, you get an "LSN", which is a file number and
byte offset for where that hunk of data is stored.  Given the LSN,
it's trivial matter (with very low overhead) to retrieve any hunk in
any desired access pattern.

I added a couple of features that Berkeley DB's logging subsystem does
not have:

1. Each hunk written to the log can contain multiple blobs (or perhaps
sub-hunks?).  So instead of identifying a hunk by `{FileNum,Offset}`
it would be identified by `{FileNum,Offset,HunkNumber}`.  I don't
believe this feature is actually used by Hibari, but the CPU and
storage overheads to support it are low enough to be ignored.
2. For any given hunk, each blob can have an MD5 checksum to detect
corruption of the blob.

The `gmt_hlog.erl` module started as the sole implementation module of
a write-ahead log.  Later, it was split into three separate modules:

`gmt_hlog.erl`::
This module manages all of the directories and files used to store
write-ahead log data.  The separation of "common log" and "brick
private logs" is merely a matter of which directory each type of log
uses; both types of logs use exactly the same file data structures.
+
`gmt_hlog_common.erl`::
This module maintains the "common log" storage area.
+
`gmt_hlog_local.erl`::
This module is a code proxy/intermediate layer between a brick and the
actual write-ahead logs that it relies upon.  This module maintains
the barrier between the "common log" and the brick's private metadata
write-ahead log.  Much of the `gmt_hlog_local` exported API are just
2-line wrappers around calls to `gmt_hlog` functions, because there is
nothing for the proxy to do in those cases.

[[glossary-write-ahead-log-terms]]
===== Glossary for write-ahead log terms

Log:: A collection of log files.
Log file:: A single file that stores hunks as part of a larger
collection known as a "log".
Log sequence number:: The integer used to name a specific log file.
The sign of the log sequence number, i.e. positive or negative, may
change (see below) but the absolute value of the integer may not.
Hunk:: A collection of blobs that is appended as an atomic
unit to the end of the log's latest log file.
`{SeqNum, Offset}`::  This tuple uniquely identifies a hunk.
It is directly analogous to the Berkeley DB "LSN" (Log Sequence
Number).  Together with the directory path for the log, any
part of the hunk can be retrieved via random access.
Hunk type:: A 32-bit integer that describes the type of hunk.
Mostly useful for application use.
Blob:: An Erlang binary term.
CBlob/c_blob:: A blob that also has an MD5 checksum stored inside
the hunk.
UBlob/u_blob:: A blob without an MD5 checksum.

[[shortterm-and-longterm-storage]]
===== Short term vs. long term log storage

First, let's have a short review of Hibari brick disk storage
properties and goals.  See the
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#write-ahead-logs[Hibari Sysadmin
Guide, "Write-Ahead Logs" section]
and also the
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#brick-init["Brick Initialization" section]
for background info.

1. A logical brick stores all key metadata in RAM.
2. All key updates (including ) are written to the write-ahead log.
   ** This metadata includes the `{FileNum,Offset}` storage location
   of disk-based value blob hunks, which are stored separately from
   key metadata hunks.
3. The write-ahead log is not, by itself, a random-access data
   structure in the way that a disk-based B-tree or hash table.
4. It is desirable to eliminate as much random disk I/O as much as
   possible.
5. After a crash, it is desirable to have the logical brick restart as
   quickly as possible.

As a consequence of these properties:

* After a crash, the only method to reconstruct the brick's ``key
  catalog'' is a sequential scan of the write-ahead log (because
  random access is not fully supported).
* To meet the goal of restarting quickly, it would be helpful to
  reduce the the amount of data that must be scanned sequentially.
* It is quite difficult to fully support Items #4 and #5
  simultaneously.
** Item #4 suggests that both types of data hunks, key metadata and
   value blobs, be written into the same log to reduce disk I/O.
** Item #5 suggests that both types of data hunks be written in
   separate locations to make brick startup, specifically the scan &
   reconstruction of the key catalog, as fast as possible.

The implementation of `gmt_hlog.erl` tries to resolve the conflict
between I/O efficiency and short startup times by storing data in
files stored in two different areas:

The short term area (`shortterm` in the code)::
All key metadata hunks are always stored in shortterm storage.  To
support item #4, value blob hunks are also be written in short term
storage in order to amortize the expense of `fsync(2)` system calls.
** Log files in short term storage have positive log sequence numbers.
** Log files in short term storage can be found in the `"s"`
   subdirectory, where "s" is an abbreviation for "short".
+
The long term area (`longterm` in the code)::
All long-lived value blob hunks, i.e. those hunks which have existed
long enough to exist after a checkpoint operation, are stored in long
term storage.
** Log files in long term storage have negative log sequence numbers.
** Log files in long term storage are hashed and stored in one of many
   subdirectories, to avoid having millions of files all inside a
   single directory.

-----------------------------------

The application can request that a hunk be written into either area by
the write-ahead log.  As examples:

* All key updates (key metadata hunks and value blob hunks) are always
  written to the short term area.
* Checkpoint data is always written to the short term area.
* The scavenger reads value blob hunks that are still ``alive'' from
  their current location and always writes them to the long term area.

An entire log file can moved from short term storage to long term
storage by renaming it to its long term name, i.e from a positive log
sequence number to a negative log sequence number.  This renaming
operation is done at the end of a checkpoint operation by bricks that
store value blobs on disk: see the "Brick checkpoint processing steps"
list in
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#checkpoints[Hibari Sysadmin
Guide, "Brick Checkpoint Operations" section].

Log files cannot move from long term to short term storage.

Given the separation of various log hunk types into short term and
long term storage, we have a couple of new properties:

1. The number of log sequence files in short term storage will be
   quite small, usually well under 1,000 files total and typically
   under 100 files.
** This gets us most of the way to our goal of, "brick
   startup must be fast."  All key metadata is stored in the short term
   area.  Therefore we only need to read sequentially a fairly small
   number of files to reconstruct the brick's key catalog.
2. The number of log sequence files in long term storage can be huge,
   perhaps millions of files.
** Millions of files in the long term area can create
   a storage problem.  Many OS file systems cannot efficiently handle too
   many files within a single directory.  The long term storage area uses
   two levels of intermediate directories to avoid directories that are
   "too big".

NOTE: In theory, the constants to define the number of subdirectories
at each level are completely flexible.  In reality, use of the
`?ARCH_H1_SIZE` and `?ARCH_H2_SIZE` macros is hard-coded in some
critical areas.

===== Writing hunks and flushing them to stable storage

There's a fundamental tension between writing hunks to disk as
efficiently as possible and flushing them to stable storage via the
`fsync(2)` system call.  The latency overhead of `fsync(2)` on
Winchester disks is extremely high.  Also, Linux-based systems can
block writes to a file descriptor when an `fsync(2)` operation is in
progress.

To mitigate the effects of `fsync(2)` calls, a couple of strategies
are used.  First, `file:sync/1` calls are performed asynchronously
when feasible.  Second, writes are buffered by the log's "gen_server"
process while an `file:sync/1` call is in progress.  The "gen_server"
will promise to write the hunk at a given `{FileNum,Offset}` location
but won't actually write the data there until the `fsync(2)` is
finished.

The "gen_server"'s write buffering opens up a can of worms: nasty race
conditions.  Races with write requests, fsync requests, in-progress
fsync calls, and "advance sequence number" requests are possible.
This module has been extensively reviewed and tested with both unit
tests and QuickCheck to eliminate those race conditions.  We believe
that all bugs have been eliminated, but as with many things in the
software world, we don't really know with 100% certainty.

===== Application-level and OS-level readahead

See link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#os-readahead-configuration[Hibari
Sysadmin Guide, "OS Readahead Configuration" section] for background.

The key metadata for disk-based value blob storage contains both the
storage location of the value blob hunk *and* the size of the blob.
The blob's size is usually passed through the `gmt_hlog` API when
reading the blob.  First the hunk header must be read and then the
value blob can be read.  A function like `read_hunk_summary/5` uses
the blob size argument to help combine (further down in the call
chain) the two reads into a single `file:pread()` call via the
`my_pread/4` function.

The `my_pread/4` function is a simple application-level readahead
mechanism.  The two major types of read operations both have elements
of readahead to them:

1. For reads during brick initialization, the write-ahead log scan is
   reading many small-sized hunks in sequential order.  The average
   size of a key metadata hunk is less than 200 bytes, so a read-ahead
   of 4KB or 8KB is very helpful (though a bigger size would reduce
   CPU consumption even more).
2. For the random reads of value blobs hunks, adding the estimated
   size of the hunk header and the known size of the value blob makes
   it possible to read both with a single `file:pread()` call.

[[refactor-my-pread]]
[NOTE]
=======================
The code path of hunk reads, by both sequential reads during brick
init and random reads of value blob hunks, is probably sub-optimal.
The addition of `?MY_PREAD_MODEST_READAHEAD_BYTES` to the readahead
size by `read_hunk_summ_ll_middle/3` is a good thing (and should
probably be even bigger) in the former case and a bad thing for the
latter case.  Refactoring might be a good idea here.

Function tracing verifies that `read_hunk_summ_ll_middle/3` is
definitely used by the latter case.  But for random read I/O, reading
the extra `?MY_PREAD_MODEST_READAHEAD_BYTES` bytes is very unlikely to
have any benefit and quite possibly has negative impact.
=======================

NOTE: See also, the discussion at xref:squid-flash-priming.

===== MD5 checksums

See xref:controlling-md5-checksums[].

===== API comments

[[refactor-gmt-hlog]]
NOTE: Parts of the exported API for this module may seem cumbersome to
use.  Those parts are from a bottom-up code writing experiment that
created only exported APIs needed for very specific tasks, not to
create a more useful (generally-speaking) interface.  A refactoring
exercise could be useful here.

[[gmt-hlog-erl-processes]]
===== Processes created by gmt_hlog.erl

* Very short-lived processes to finish `{read_hunk,...}`
  `{get_all_seqnums}`, and `{sync}`  calls.

[[gmt-hlog-common-erl]]
==== gmt_hlog_common.erl

This module is responsible for combining write & fsync requests from
multiple bricks, via their `gmt_hlog_common` private write-ahead log
servers, into a single write-ahead log.  The writes and fsyncs must
provide a durable storage service (to prevent data loss), and
performance must be good enough (despite the slow speed of `fsync(2)`
operations on Winchester disk drives).

The "short term/long term" storage areas are described in
xref:gmt-hlog-erl[].  Together with `gmt_hlog_local.erl`, this module
creates a different separation of hunk types:

* Key metadata hunks, type = `?LOGTYPE_METADATA`.
** To maintain the illusion of each logical brick maintaining its own
   private write-ahead log, hunks of type `?LOGTYPE_METADATA` are copied
   asynchronously out of the common log and into their pre-chosen
   `{FileNum,Offset}` location in the brick's private write-ahead log by
   the `do_sync_writeback/1` function.  When a logical brick restarts,
   all common -> private log writebacks are performed synchronously
   via `full_writeback/1` before the brick is allowed to restart.
* Value blob hunks, type = `?LOGTYPE_BLOB`
* Bad sequence hunks, type = `?LOGTYPE_BAD_SEQUENCE`

[[refactor-os-sync]]
[IMPORTANT]
===================
The common -> private log writebacks are performed
lazily/asynchronously and do not use `fsync(2)` to flush to disk.
Instead, a
time-based mechanism is used, assuming that the OS has flushed all
writeback data to stable storage within a generous time limit
(configured by the `brick_dirty_buffer_wait` configuration attribute
in `central.conf`).  The advantage is to allow the OS to combine
various dirty page writes into as few disk I/O operations as possible
without interference from `fsync(2)` calls.

This assumption works for Linux platforms but probably isn't valid for
FreeBSD and Mac OS.  It would be straightforward to use `file:sync(2)`
in a background task to flush these writebacks very infrequently (to
allow write coalescing), but that refactoring has not been performed
yet.
===================

[[refactor-hunk-writeback]]
NOTE: The `write_back_to_local_log/8` function's goal is to perform
individual hunk writebacks as efficiently as possible, i.e. with as
few file open/write/close operations as possible.  The logic is
tortuous and difficult to debug.  It's probably correct now, but a
refactoring might be a good idea.

===== Separate file systems for common log short term and long term

Another part of the lazy writeback process is to manage the transition
of files from the common log's ``short term'' storage area to ``long
term'' storage.  See xref:shortterm-and-longterm-storage[] for
background; see
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#high-io-rate-devices[Hibari Sysadmin
Guide, "High I/O rate devices (e.g. SSD) may be used" section] for a
discussion of using high-speed non-volatile storage such as
solid-state memory disks.

If SSD or similar disk is used, then a file system for that disk
should be mounted under the common log's short term directory:
`.../var/data/hlog.commonLogServer/s`.  The
`do_bigblob_hunk_writeback/3` function, together with
`clean_old_seqnums/2`, will take care of copying the `?LOGTYPE_BLOB`
hunks from the short term file system to the long term file system,
which (we assume) will use traditional, cheap Winchester-type disk drives.

===== Scavenger

See also: xref:scavenger-and-code-reuse[].

[[refactor-scav-mapreduce]]
[NOTE]
=======================

The scavenger presents another refactoring opportunity.  An earlier
version was much simpler, but it relied too heavily on in-memory
sorting and consumed too much memory when scavenging systems
containing tens of millions of keys.

The current implementation is quite brute-force now.  Perhaps a more
explicitly map-reduce style, while still preserving disk-based
sorting, would be useful?
=======================

===== Brick registration

When the scavenger copies a `?LOGTYPE_BLOB` hunk to its new storage
location, the brick that owns that value blob must be notified of its
new location.  A brick that isn't running & in `ok` state cannot (by
definition) handle such notifications.  If all logical bricks are not
running, the scavenger should be aborted.

The `register_local_brick/2` function is used by a brick's startup to
assist the common log keep track of all logical bricks that may have
records stored in the common log.  If a registered brick is not
running when the scavenger starts, the scavenger will be aborted.
Brick failures during the scavenger's run are handled separately.

[[gmt-hlog-common-erl-processes]]
===== Processes created by gmt_hlog_common.erl

* A `gmt_hlog` "gen-server" process to handle I/O to and from the
  "common log".
* The scavenger is run in a separate process that may run for 0
  seconds to a few hours.
* Short-lived processes to handle fsync requests.
* Short-lived processes to perform tasks that were deferred until
  after the `brick_dirty_buffer_wait` time interval has passed.
* A short-lived process to avoid blocking the OTP supervisor framework
  when shutting down the `gdss` application in certain MD5 checksum
  failure scenarios.

[[gmt-hlog-local-erl]]
==== gmt_hlog_local.erl

The `gmt_hlog_local.erl` module's purpose is to present the same
client API as `gmt_hlog.erl` while providing the "common log"/"private
log" split that is described in the
link:hibari-sysadmin-guide.en.html#write-ahead-logs-in-hibari[Hibari Sysadmin
Guide, "Write-ahead logs in the Hibari application" section].

This module uses atoms for mapping to hunk metadata types:

* `metadata` -> `?LOGTYPE_METADATA`
* `bigblob` -> `?LOGTYPE_BLOB`

The most important thing this module does is maintain the
`{FileNum,Offset}` storage locations for the private log.  This task
is done with some knowledge of the internal workings of
`gmt_hlog.erl`:

1. Use `gmt_hlog:create_hunk/3` to create a fully-serialized hunk.
2. Wrap the serialized hunk in a `{eee,...}` tuple and write it to the
   common log.
3. If the common log write was successful, return a reply to the client
   using the `{FileNum,Offset}` maintained for the private log, *not*
   the storage location given by the common log.
4. Sometime in the near future, the common log will
   lazily/asynchronously locate all of the recently-written `{eee,...}`
   tuples for this brick and copy the serialized hunks to the exact
   storage locations specified by step #3.

IMPORTANT: Step #4 in the outline above has a huge race vulnerability
window.  Any test that tries to write a hunk using
`gmt_hlog_local.erl` and then immediately read that hunk will almost
certainly fail.  If you must read something that was very recently
written, you must call `gmt_hlog_common:full_writeback/1` before
attempting the read.

[[gmt-hlog-local-erl-processes]]
===== Processes created by gmt_hlog_local.erl

* A `gmt_hlog` "gen-server" process to handle I/O to and from the
  brick's "private log".
* Very short-lived processes to finish `{get_all_seqnums}` and
  `{sync}` calls.

[[mod-admin-erl]]
==== mod_admin.erl

This is the callback module for the `inets` application's HTTP server
for the Admin Server's HTTP status server at `http://localhost:23080/`
(default URL).

[[refactor-mod-admin]]
NOTE: There's room for refactoring here.  This module was written by a
developer who was relatively new to Erlang and learning as he went
along.  Also, there is a large number of administrative tasks that the
Admin Server's HTTP service does not yet support,
e.g. changing chain length, adding/removing/reweighting chains.

[[debugging-hibari-using-tracing]]
=== Debugging Hibari (clients and servers) using tracing

Sooner or later, a Hibari developer will need to do some debugging.
It may be a learning exercise, trying to figure out what existing code
is doing.  Or perhaps it's new code that needs debugging.  In either
case, there are several sets of tools available to Erlang developers.

The OTP "debugger" application is useful because it provides a GUI
that many developers find comfortable, particularly the "breakpoint"
feature.  However, "debugger" app doesn't always work very well with
Hibari, especially on the server side.

* With the large amount of inter-process messaging, it can be
  difficult to identify which modules should be loaded into the
  debugger and where breakpoints should be added.
* Once a breakpoint is set, multiple processes (e.g. multiple bricks)
  may trigger it, but you are only interested in one specific process.
* Most of the inter-process messaging uses timeouts on the client
  side.  It's unlikely that a developer can point-and-click the "Step"
  and "Continue" buttons on the GUI quickly enough to allow a server
  to respond before the client side stub code times out.
* When a logical brick or write-ahead log server process is stopped by
  a breakpoint, the Admin Server may interpret the break as a
  failure ... and then take actions to kill and restart that brick.

Therefore, we recommend that you use tracing-based tools for debugging
Hibari.  These tools do not require a GUI, so it's possible to use
them for diagnosing remote systems where a GUI may be impossible to
support.  Also, the tracing tools give much finer control over what
process (or processes) will be traced.

==== External applications/tools

The Erlang/OTP runtime system provides an extremely powerful set of
tracing tools.  See the
link:http://www.erlang.org/doc/[Erlang/OTP documentation] in the
"Tools" section for several applications that are built on top of
Erlang's tracing primitives: "dbg" (in the "runtime_tools"
subsection), "observer", "inviso", and others.

Gemini has had very positive experience with the "redbug"
application.  "Redbug" is bundled with the commercial packaging of
Hibari and is used frequently by both customer operations staff and
Gemini field engineers to diagnose problems with both Hibari client
applications and the Hibari server.

* The "redbug" tool is part of the
link:http://code.google.com/p/eper/["eper" tool suite at Google Code:
http://code.google.com/p/eper/].

==== Hibari internal tracepoints

The Hibari source code has been annotated with over 400 tracepoints
using macros based on the `gmt_elog.erl` and `gmt_elog_policy.erl`
modules.  These tracepoints give the developer (and even field support
staff) more options for tracing events through Hibari's code.

The `gmt_elog` tracepoints are designed to be extremely lightweight.
While they can be disabled completely at compile-time, their overhead
is so low that they can remain in production code and be enabled only
when needed for debugging.

For example, on an x86 laptop with the CPU frequency fixed at 1.33GHz,
a microbenchmark that called a `gmt_elog_policy` tracepoint when
system tracing was disabled (i.e. normal system state) executed
88999000 trace calls in 12.925467 seconds, averaging 6.886 million
calls/second.

===== Major tracepoint types

There are two major types of tracepoints that annotate the Hibari
code.  The macros for both types are defined in the `brick.hrl` header
file.  The underlying mechanism is provided by macros in the
`gmt_elog.hrl` header file.

* The `?E_`* macros, e.g. `?E_INFO/2`, `?E_ERROR/2`.  These macros are
  similar in spirit to the C library's `syslog(3)` function: free-form
  message text (with formatting by `io_lib:format/2`) with a severity
  level.
+
These macros actually perform two functions: generate an
application log event via `error_logger` and optionally generate a
`gmt_elog` trace message.  When examining large traces, it proved
_extremely inconvenient_ to try to merge application log messages into
the flow of trace output ... so now the macros perform that merging
task automatically.
+
* For trace events that do not merit an application log entry using
  `error_logger`, the `?DBG_`* macros provide a convenient way to
  specify:
** A general category (for trace filtering)
** One of:
*** A generic Erlang term (usually a tuple)
*** `io_lib:format/2` style formatted text

.`?E_INFO/2` macro's definition:
----------
-define(E_INFO(Fmt, Args),
        begin ?ELOG_INFO_C(?CAT_GENERAL, Fmt, Args),
              error_logger:info_msg(Fmt, Args)
        end).
----------

The `?DBG_`* macros use the following filtering categories.  The
categories use integers with C-style bit masks to allow a single trace
message to use multiple categories by bit-wise AND'ing the categories
together.

.`?DBG_`* categories from `brick.hrl`
----------
%% Any component
-define(CAT_GENERAL,              (1 bsl  0)). % General: init, terminate, ...

%% brick_ets, mostly, except where there's cross-over purpose.
-define(CAT_OP,                   (1 bsl  1)). % Op processing
-define(CAT_ETS,                  (1 bsl  2)). % ETS table
-define(CAT_TLOG,                 (1 bsl  3)). % Txn log
-define(CAT_REPAIR,               (1 bsl  4)). % Repair

%% brick_server, mostly, except where there's cross-over purpose.
-define(CAT_CHAIN,                (1 bsl  5)). % Chain-related
-define(CAT_MIGRATE,              (1 bsl  6)). % Migration-related
-define(CAT_HASH,                 (1 bsl  7)). % Hash-related
----------

Here are a couple of examples of using these macros.

.Sample usage of `?E_INFO` and `?DBG_ETSx/2`
----------
?E_INFO("~s: got unknown message ~P\n", [?MODULE, Msg, 20]).

%% Example of ?DBG_ETSx()
?DBG_ETSx({inserted, S#state.tab, Key, size(Val)}).
----------

In the end, the result of both these macros is a call to
`gmt_elog_policy:enabled/6`.  By default, this function does not do
anything.  For lowest overhead, it should do nothing.  It doesn't
*need* to do anything, because the Erlang tracing mechanism will do
what we need if and when we need to activate the tracing.

.The `gmt_elog_policy:enabled/6` function
----------
enabled(_Priority, _Category, _Module, _Line, _Fmt, _ArgList) ->
    false.
----------

When enabled, the Erlang VM's tracing mechanism will tell us the
module name, function name, and arguments of any function call that
meets its match specification.  When tracing is not enabled, almost no
computation is performed.

The arguments for the `enabled/6` function are usually generated by
macros for convenience.  The arguments are:

Priority, `term()`::
The Hibari app macros use an integer for this
argument, using `syslog(3)`-like priority numbers (which are defined
in `gmt_applog.hrl`, e.g. `?LOG_EMERG_PRI` is level 0, `?LOG_INFO_PRI`
is level 6.
+
Category, `term()`::
The Hibari app macros use an integer for this argument, using the
bitmask-style encoding shown above, e.g. `?CAT_ETS` -> `(1 bsl 2)`.
+
Module, `atom()`::
This is the name of the module that is making the tracing call.
+
Line, `integer()`::
This is the line number of the source module that is making the
tracing call.
+
Fmt, `string()`::
An `io_lib:format/2` formatting string.
+
ArgList, `string()`::
An `io_lib:format/2` formatting argument list.
+
NOTE: The `Fmt` and `ArgList` arguments are used for the `?DBG_`*
style macros, because arguments are used by the log trace formatting
functions to do the actual log trace formatting.

===== Trace collection and formatting

The `gmt_elog:help/0` function provides a quick reference for how to
use the `gmt_elog` tracing functions.

.Example of `gmt_elog:help/0` usage.
------------------
(hibari_dev@bb3)56> gmt_elog:help().
  gmt_elog:start_tracing().
  gmt_elog:start_tracing("/path/to/trace-file").
  gmt_elog:add_match_spec().         ... to trace everything
  gmt_elog:add_match_spec(dbg:fun2ms(fun([_, target_category, _, _, _, _]) -> return_trace() end)).
  gmt_elog:add_match_spec(dbg:fun2ms(fun([Pri, _, _, _, _, _]) when Prio > 0 -> return_trace() end)).
  gmt_elog:add_match_spec(dbg:fun2ms(fun([_, target_category, target_module, _, _, _]) -> return_trace();
                                        ([_, _, other_module, 88, _, _]) -> return_trace() end)).
  gmt_elog:del_match_spec().
  gmt_elog:stop_tracing().
  gmt_elog:format_file("/path/to/trace-file").
  gmt_elog:format_file("/path/to/trace-file", "/path/to/output").
  gmt_elog:format_file("/path/to/trace-file", "/path/to/output", MatchStr|"").
ok
------------------

When we enable tracing, we're actually tracing calls to the
`gmt_elog_policy:enabled/6` function.  As with any tracing match
specification, we can be as general (using `'_'` wildcards) or as
specific as we wish in filtering trace events.

For the examples of `add_match_spec` shown above, here is an explanation

1. Trace everything, i.e. all calls to `gmt_elog_policy:enabled/6`.
2. Trace anything where the `Category` arg == `target_category`.
   Remember that the Hibari app uses integers, not atoms, for the
   `Category` arg, so use an integer here line `8` for (1 bsl 3) for
   the `?CAT_TLOG` category.
3. Trace anything where the `Prio` argument > 0, i.e. everything that
   isn't emergency priority, `?LOG_EMERG_PRI`.
4. Trace anything where either of the following conditions is true:
   ** `Category == target_category` and `Module == target_module`
   ** `Module == other_module` and `Line == 88`

.Outline of a typical tracing session
-------------------
> gmt_elog:start_tracing("/tmp/trace-file1").
> gmt_elog:add_match_spec(dbg:fun2ms(fun([_, Cat, _, _, _, _]) when Cat == 1 -> return_trace() end)).
> %% ... trigger some activity that you wish to trace
> %% ... when you are finished, resume with:
> gmt_elog:del_match_spec().
> gmt_elog:stop_tracing().
> gmt_elog:format_file("/tmp/trace-file1", "/tmp/trace-file1.out").
-------------------

If you have a low volume of trace messages, it may be convenient to
use `gmt_elog:start_tracing/0` to send those messages to the shell
window instead of to a file.

== Appendix: Troubleshooting

The subsections here are an assortment of items that were inconvenient
to add in-line elsewhere in this guide.  Like Erlang's "let it crash"
philosophy, it's a bit tidier to let something else handle
exceptions.  This section is the "something else".

[[problem-multiple-hibari-apps]]
=== Problem: Cannot run multiple Hibari apps on the same physical machine

Although it is possible to run the Hibari app multiple times
simultaneously on the same physical machine (or guest OS instance, if
you're using virtualization software such as VMware or Xen), it isn't
always easy.  There are two reasons why Hibari might not be able to
run on a machine:

==== Multiple Erlang VMs with the same node name

Erlang node names take the form `VM_Name@Host_Name`, using the "short"
host naming convention, via "erl -sname VM_Name@Host_Name".  It is not
possible to run two Erlang virtual machines with the same "VM_Name".

.Example of Erlang node name conflict: `duplicate_name`
-------------------
{error_logger,{{2010,4,14},{19,41,28}},"Protocol: ~p: register error: ~p~n",["inet_tcp",{{badmatch,{error,duplicate_name}},
[{inet_tcp_dist,listen,1},{net_kernel,start_protos,4},{net_kernel,start_protos,3},{net_kernel,init_node,2},
{net_kernel,init,1},{gen_server,init_it,6},{proc_lib,init_p_do_apply,3}]}]}
-------------------

*If run in developer's interactive mode*,
(e.g. xref:starting-hibari-1st-time[]), the node name is defined in
`gdss/src/Makefile`.  Edit the `NODENAME1` variable in `Makefile`, then
re-run your `make` command.

*If run as a daemon*,
the Erlang node name is taken from the `central.conf`
file, the `application_nodename` attribute.  Running multiple
instances of Hibari using the same installation directory will use the
same `central.conf` file.  The work-around is to install Hibari
multiple times, one for each Erlang VM instance.  Each installation
will require a different installation prefix,
e.g. `/usr/local/hibari1` and `/usr/local/hibari2`.  Then the
`application_nodename` attribute in each `central.conf` file can
contain a unique value.

NOTE: The multiple-installation path technique above is not sufficient
for running multiple Hibari daemons/virtual machines on the same box.
See also xref:multiple-hibari-instances-TCP-conflicts[].

[[multiple-hibari-instances-TCP-conflicts]]
==== Multiple Hibari instances have TCP port conflicts

.TCP port conflict: `eaddrinuse` (with Admin Server HTTP Web server on TCP port 23080)
----------
=GMT ERR REPORT==== 14-Apr-2010::19:43:19 ===
std_error: "Failed initiating web server: \nundefined\n{{listen,eaddrinuse},\n {child,undefined,\n        {httpd_acceptor,any,23080},\n....
----------

The error message below may be hidden among other app log messages,
both related to startup as well as the premature shutdown.

Using a utility like `grep` in the `brick.log` file (interactive mode)
or `.../var/log/gdss-app.log` file (daemon mode) might be more
helpful.  Look for the pattern `eaddrinuse`.

Port conflicts can exist for a number of TCP ports used by Hibari:

The Admin HTTP server:: Configured by an Erlang/OTP configuration file
(and not `central.conf`)
* In developer interactive mode, see the file
`./root/conf/admin.conf`, relative to your current working dir
(i.e. the `gdss/src` subdirectory).
* In daemon mode, see `/path/to/hibari-top/gdss/1.0.0/etc/root/conf/admin.conf`
* In either situation above, edit the "Port" line at the top of the file.
Other TCP ports:: Configured by the `central.conf` file.
* In developer interactive mode, see `../priv/central.conf`.
* In daemon mode, see `/path/to/hibari-top/gdss/1.0.0/etc/central.conf`
* In either situation above, edit the appropriate attribute, e.g.
  `cli_port`, `brick_s3_tcp_port`, `gdss_ebf_tcp_port`, and so on.

== Appendix: Known Warts, Problems, Inefficiencies, Refactoring Opportunities, etc.

* Hibari does not yet have a comprehensive backup & restore mechanism,
  in the sense of "dump all contents of the entire cluster to this
  file/files" and "load this file/files back into the cluster".
+
* There's probably room for substantial improvement by refactoring
  the "syncpid" with a new algorithm (see xref:the-syncpid[]).
  I suspect that when under high load,
  switching to a fixed time interval would provide better throughput
  with similar latencies.  The problem is determining when to switch
  from one algorithm or another, or when change the size of this fixed
  time interval.
